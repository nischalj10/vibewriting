### AI-Generated Summary

1. Brief Summary:
The article discusses the importance of timing for startups, specifically addressing the question, "Why is now the right time for this idea?" It suggests that most startup ideas aren't new, but their success can hinge on factors such as new technology, regulation changes, new business models, new customer acquisition channels, or shifts in customer behavior.

2. Key Insights:
- Startups rarely come up with entirely new ideas; most have been tried and failed due to various reasons such as poor execution, counter-intuitive customer or business models, or being too early for the market.
- The author identifies five key factors that can make "now" the right time for a startup: new technology, new regulations, new business models, new user acquisition channels, and shifts in customer behavior.
- The hardest factor to predict is a shift in customer behavior, as it is often only identifiable in hindsight. However, startups that correctly identify and capitalize on these shifts can achieve significant success.
- The challenge for entrepreneurs and investors is to make educated guesses about potential shifts in customer behavior.

3. Main Takeaways:
- Entrepreneurs should consider whether their startup idea is timely, taking into account factors such as new technology, regulation changes, new business models, or new customer acquisition channels.
- Predicting shifts in customer behavior is challenging, but can lead to significant success if correctly identified and capitalized on.
- Entrepreneurs and investors need to make educated guesses about potential shifts in customer behavior, understanding that many assertions about these shifts will be incorrect, but the ones that are correct can lead to big wins.

### Original Summary

One of the most important questions for an entrepreneur is “Why is now the right time for this idea? Didn’t others try previously and fail?” There are rarely new ideas in startups. If you have an idea, someone probably already tried it and failed — maybe they mis-executed, there was something counter-intuitive about the customer or business model, or they were too early (correlated with the market not being big enough yet). If you assume other people are smart, which is generally a good practice, then they executed well and there wasn’t anything counter-intuitive going on. Earlier startups were likely just too early. So if you can’t point to an obvious misstep in prior attempts, “why now?” is often the critical question to answer. There are at least 5 classes of good answers to why now: new technology allows products that simply weren’t possible before, e.g. battery tech and electric cars new regulation, e.g. Obamacare new business model has emerged, e.g. advertising could support free content online new user acquisition channels, e.g. search/SEO, FB Platform v1 customer behavior has shifted, e.g.

### AI-Generated Summary

Summary:
The article discusses the concept of industry towns, which are geographic locations that have a critical mass of employees, entrepreneurs, suppliers, customers, and investors from a specific industry. These towns can emerge due to geography or early founding effects. The author argues that being in an industry town increases the likelihood of success for startups and careers. The article also highlights the importance of industry towns in the tech industry, with Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Bengaluru being the most prominent examples.

Key Insights:
- Industry towns are geographic locations that have a critical mass of employees, entrepreneurs, suppliers, customers, and investors from a specific industry. They can emerge due to geography or early founding effects.
- Being in an industry town increases the likelihood of success for startups and careers. Market capitalization, revenue, key partnerships, and outsized talent tend to aggregate in industry towns.
- The tech industry also has its industry towns, with Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Bengaluru being the most prominent examples. These locations have a high concentration of talent, early customers, unique insights and know-how, smart investors, and service providers.
- Online software markets have grown at least 10X in the last 10 years, making it easier to start a billion-dollar company from anywhere in the world. However, technology market cap continues to grow most for startups in technology clusters or industry towns.
- The rise of distributed teams means that more companies are hiring outside of their HQ city more quickly. However, distributed teams have a cost and require early investment in processes.

Main Takeaways:
- If you're planning to start a company or build a career in a specific industry, consider moving to an industry town for that industry. This can increase your chances of success.
- If you're in the tech industry, consider locations like Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Bengaluru. These locations have a high concentration of talent, early customers, unique insights and know-how, smart investors, and service providers.
- While it's now easier to start a billion-dollar company from anywhere in the world, technology market cap continues to grow most for startups in technology clusters or industry towns. Therefore, being in an industry town can still provide significant advantages.

### Original Summary

Industry towns[1] emerge due to the critical mass of having employees, entrepreneurs, suppliers, business partners, potential customers, and investors in the same geographic location. Some industry towns are driven by their geography - for example manufacturing sites on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border, Houston for oil & gas, or wineries in Napa (where the right conditions exist for grapes to grow). Other industry towns emerge due to early founding effects - for example Detroit largely emerged as an automotive center as Henry Ford and Ransom Olds happened to live there when they set up shop (Ford Motor Company and Oldsmobile)[2]. Other companies and suppliers moved to be close to Ford and Oldsmobile and an industry town was born.If you were going into the movie business, you would be encouraged to move to Hollywood, Lagos, or Mumbai. If you wanted to go into finance, New York, London, and Hong Kong would be amongst the primary places to move. Industry towns exist for most major industries, including energy, finance, movies and entertainment and other areas.

### AI-Generated Summary

1. Brief Summary:
The article emphasizes the importance of viewing startups as projects rather than companies. The author argues that this mindset encourages flexibility, focus, and the freedom to experiment with unconventional ideas without the pressure of high expectations. 

2. Key Insights:
   - The author initially felt that being referred to as a "project" was dismissive, but has since changed their perspective, believing it's beneficial to be thought of as a project rather than a company.
   - Thinking of a startup as a company can lead to distractions such as legal matters, conferences, and financial issues, rather than focusing on product development.
   - Projects have lower expectations, which can foster creativity and risk-taking, while companies face higher expectations and pressure for results, which can stifle innovation.
   - Many successful companies, including Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, and Airbnb, started as projects, allowing them to experiment and evolve before becoming established companies.
   - The pressure of external and internal expectations can kill innovative ideas, which is why it's beneficial to start as a project with lower expectations.

3. Main Takeaways:
   - Startups should consider themselves as projects rather than companies to foster creativity, flexibility, and focus on product development.
   - Lower expectations associated with projects can encourage risk-taking and experimentation, which are key to innovation.
   - Founders should resist the rush to claim their startups as companies, as this can lead to high expectations and pressure that can stifle innovation.

### Original Summary

In the early days of my startup, I used to get slightly offended when people would refer to it as a “project”. “How’s your project going?” seemed like the asker didn't take us seriously, even though everything felt serious to us. I remember assuming this would stop after we announced a $5 million Series A; it didn’t. I kept feeling like we’d know we made it when people started referring to us a company.I now have the opposite belief. It’s far better to be thought of — and to think of yourself — as a project than a company for as long as possible. Companies sound serious. When you start thinking of yourself as a company, you start acting like one. You worry more about pretend work involving things like lawyers, conferences, and finance stuff, and less about building product, because that’s what people who run companies are supposed to do. This is, of course, the kiss of death for promising ideas. Projects have very low expectations, which is great. Projects also usually mean less people and less money, so you get the good parts of both flexibility and focus.

### AI-Generated Summary

1. Brief Summary:
The article discusses the importance of hobbies, particularly in the technology sector, as a source of innovation and future industry trends. It suggests that what the smartest people do in their free time, unconstrained by immediate financial goals, often leads to the creation of breakthrough technologies and industries within a decade.

2. Key Insights:
   - Many significant technological advancements have originated from hobbyists working in their spare time.
   - Hobbies are crucial because they allow smart people to focus on inventing new things without the pressure of immediate financial returns.
   - Current tech hobbies with momentum include math-based currencies like Bitcoin, new software development tools like NoSQL databases, the internet of things, 3D printing, touch-free human/computer interfaces, and artisanal hardware.
   - These hobbies are likely to seed future industries, indicating that what smart people do in their leisure time today could become mainstream in the next ten years.

3. Main Takeaways:
   - Encourage and foster hobbies, especially in the tech sector, as they often lead to significant innovations.
   - Keep an eye on current tech hobbies as they can provide insight into future industry trends.
   - Recognize the value of time and creativity not driven by immediate financial goals in driving technological advancements.

### Original Summary

What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years2013-03-02Many breakthrough technologies were hatched by hobbyists in garages and dorm rooms. Prominent examples include the PC, the web, blogs, and most open source software. The fact that flip-flop wearing hobbyists spawn large industries is commonly viewed as an amusing eccentricity of the technology industry. But there is a reason why hobbies are so important. Business people vote with their dollars, and are mostly trying to create near-term financial returns. Engineers vote with their time, and are mostly trying to invent interesting new things. Hobbies are what the smartest people spend their time on when they aren’t constrained by near-term financial goals. Today, the tech hobbies with momentum include: math-based currencies like Bitcoin, new software development tools like NoSQL databases, the internet of things, 3D printing, touch-free human/computer interfaces, and “artisanal” hardware like the kind you find on Kickstarter. It’s a good bet these present-day hobbies will seed future industries. What the smartest people do on the weekends is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years.

### Original Summary

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Technological change An 1880 penny-farthing (left), and an 1886 Rover safety bicycle with gearing In business theory, disruptive innovation is innovation that creates a new market and value network or enters at the bottom of an existing market and eventually displaces established market-leading firms, products, and alliances.[1] The term, "disruptive innovation" was popularized by the American academic Clayton Christensen and his collaborators beginning in 1995,[2] but the concept had been previously described in Richard N. Foster's book Innovation: The Attacker's Advantage and in the paper "Strategic responses to technological threats",[3] as well as by Joseph Schumpeter in the book Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (as creative destruction). Not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the first automobiles in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in 1908.[4] The mass-produced automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not.

### AI-Generated Summary

Summary:
The article by Elad Gil emphasizes the importance of choosing the right market for entrepreneurs. It discusses the factors to consider when assessing a market, such as changes in the market, underserved customer bases, industry growth, market structure, and market hype. The author advises entrepreneurs to aim for big opportunities and to consider sub-markets within a given market.

Key Insights:
- The market an entrepreneur chooses can significantly impact the success of their venture.
- Good markets usually have changes that allow new players to emerge, such as falling costs, new distribution channels, new technology, and new sources of customers or demand.
- Entrepreneurs should consider if a growing customer base is being dramatically underserved, as this can present a significant opportunity.
- Rapidly growing industries can provide substantial opportunities for new businesses.
- Market structure is crucial; markets dominated by a few large players can limit potential growth and profitability. 

Main Takeaways:
- Entrepreneurs should carefully assess their chosen market, considering factors such as changes, customer base, industry growth, and market structure.
- It's beneficial to target underserved, growing customer bases and to operate in rapidly growing industries.
- Entrepreneurs should be wary of markets dominated by a few large players, as this can limit growth and profitability.

### Original Summary

One of the single most important decisions for an entrepreneur is to chose the market they are in.From Marc Andreessen's blog on Andy Rachleff's (formerly of Benchmark Capital) Law of Startup Success:"The #1 company-killer is lack of market. Andy puts it this way:When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.When a great team meets a great market, something special happens."So, one of the big questions I often discuss with entrepreneurs is, how can you tell if a market is a great one?Questions to ask yourself about the market:What has changed? Why now? Good markets typically have something changing in them, that allows new players to enter or emerge. For example, GroupOn was able to capitalize on a combination of a new distribution mechanism (social media shares) and merchant and consumer familiarity and comfort in selling/buying things online. Examples:Costs have fallen or price points risen dramatically. Many SaaS services are examples of low cost approaches to existing enterprise software businesses.

## Joel on Software

**Author:** Joel Spolsky

**Link:** https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/

### AI-Generated Summary

**Summary:**

The article by Joel Spolsky, "Joel on Software," discusses the economic principles of substitutes and complements in the context of the software industry, particularly open source software. He argues that companies invest in open source software not out of ideological commitment, but because it's a good business strategy. He also explains how the principle of complements, where demand for a product increases when the price of its complements decreases, applies to various tech companies and their strategies.

**Key Insights:**

- Companies invest in open source software as a business strategy, not because they believe in the ideology of open source. They aim to commoditize their products' complements to increase demand for their own products.
- The principle of complements states that demand for a product increases when the prices of its complements decrease. This principle is used by many tech companies to increase demand for their products.
- Examples of companies applying the principle of complements include IBM commoditizing enterprise software to boost its IT consulting business, Netscape open sourcing their web browser to commoditize the browser market, and Transmeta supporting Linux to make operating systems a commodity.
- Despite being free, open source software is not exempt from economic laws. The cost of developing, maintaining, and switching to open source software is non-zero, and these costs can impact its adoption.
- Sun Microsystems' strategy of promoting Java and open source software, despite being a hardware company, is seen as counterproductive as it commoditizes both hardware and software, potentially reducing Sun's profits.

**Main Takeaways:**

- Companies should understand the economic principles of substitutes and complements and apply them to their business strategies. Commoditizing a product's complements can increase demand for the product.
- Open source software, despite being free, has associated costs (development, maintenance, switching costs) that can impact its adoption and use.
- Companies investing in open source should consider the total cost of ownership, not just the upfront price, and should be aware of the opportunity costs involved in development and maintenance.

### Original Summary

When I was in college I took two intro economics courses: macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macro was full of theories like “low unemployment causes inflation” that never quite stood up to reality. But the micro stuff was both cool and useful. It was full of interesting concepts about the relationships between supply and demand that really did work. For example, if you have a competitor who lowers their prices, the demand for your product will go down unless you match them. In today’s episode, I’ll show how one of those concepts explains a lot about some familiar computer companies. Along the way, I noticed something interesting about open source software, which is this: most of the companies spending big money to develop open source software are doing it because it’s a good business strategy for them, not because they suddenly stopped believing in capitalism and fell in love with freedom-as-in-speech. Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements. A substitute is another product you might buy if the first product is too expensive. Chicken is a substitute for beef.

### Original Summary

How to Miss By a Mile: An Alternative Look at Uber’s Potential Market Size July 11, 2014: On June 18, Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, published an article on FiveThirtyEight titled “Uber Isn’t Worth $17 Billion.” This post was a shortened version of a more detailed post he had written for his own blog titled “A Disruptive Cab Ride to Riches: The Uber Payoff.” Using a combination of market data, math, and financial analysis, Professor Damodaran concluded that his best estimate of the value of Uber is $5.9 billion, far short of the value recently determined by the market. This estimate of value was tied to certain “assumptions” with respect to TAM (total available market) as well as Uber’s market share within that TAM. And as you would expect, his answer is critically dependent on these two assumptions. As the Series A investor and board member at Uber, I was quite intrigued when I heard that there was a FiveThirtyEight article specifically focused on the company.

## The Market Curve

**Author:** Mike Vernal

**Link:** https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-market-curve-44097b626f6d

### AI-Generated Summary

**Summary:**
The article, "The Market Curve," by Mike Vernal, discusses the importance of understanding the market for startups, particularly those founded by technologists. Vernal emphasizes that a great product is not enough for a successful business; a great market is also required. He introduces a formula for calculating market size, which is the number of customers multiplied by the revenue per customer. He further explains how this formula can be applied to different types of businesses, from enterprise sales to consumer apps.

**Key Insights:**
- The market a startup chooses to serve is crucial, and for many technologists, it's often overlooked.
- The simplest way to think about market size is by determining the number of potential customers and how much each customer might be worth.
- The position of a company on the market curve (number of customers vs. average revenue per customer) informs its sales strategy.
- Different types of businesses, from enterprise sales to consumer apps, can be analyzed using the market curve. For instance, enterprise-focused companies might have fewer customers, but they pay a lot, while consumer apps have a massive number of users but lower average revenue per user.
- Understanding the market is not just important for attracting potential investors, but it's also critical for the success of the business.

**Main Takeaways:**
- Startups should have a deep understanding of their market, including the number of potential customers and how much each customer might be worth.
- The market curve can be a useful tool for startups to determine their sales strategy and potential for growth.
- A great product alone is not enough for a successful business; a great market is also required.

### Original Summary

The Market CurveMike Vernal7 min read·Oct 29, 2020--Many of the companies we meet are founded by technologists — either young, dynamic founders with a computer science background or seasoned product managers or executives that see a better, different way of solving a problem.When we meet them, they often have pitch decks structured using the business plan framework we shared many years ago. For the best pitches, it’s clear the founders have an intuitive understanding of the problem and how their product will be a novel solution loved by users. They’ve studied the competitive landscape and know why now is the right time to start the company. The product demo is great.And then they bring up the Market slide.The Market slide is often just a big number, confidently stated (where big varies from $1B to $1T+). If you probe, it’s clear that the number is a result of googling their company’s category plus the words “market size” (e.g., “video software market size”). Critical questions are often deflected.The market you choose to serve is one of the most important factors for an early-stage startup. And for most technologists, it’s a blind spot.

### Original Summary

All Markets Are Not Created Equal: 10 Factors To Consider When Evaluating Digital Marketplaces November 13, 2012: Since Benchmark’s investment in Ebay 15 years ago, we have been fascinated by online marketplaces. Entrepreneurs accurately recognize that the connective tissue of the Internet provides an opportunity to link the players in a particular market, reducing friction in both the buying and selling experience. For example, my car tax check is an online platfrom that allows you to book a slot for a complete history and guidance of your car taxes and other details. The arrival of the smartphone amplifies these opportunities, as the Internet’s connective tissue now extends deeper and deeper into an industry with the participants connected to the marketplace 24×7 - whether they are in the office, at home, or out in the field. It is a special experience to see an entrepreneur go from a PowerPoint describing a new marketplace opportunity to having established an online hub at the epicenter of a particular industry. Following our investment in Ebay, we have been fortunate enough to invest in several companies that link consumers and suppliers through a successful online marketplace.

Money Out of Nowhere: How Internet Marketplaces Unlock Economic Wealth February 27, 2019: (*) Benchmark is/was an investor in companies labeled with the asterisk. In 1776, Adam Smith released his magnum opus, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, in which he outlined his fundamental economic theories. Front and center in the book — in fact in Book 1, Chapter 1 — is his realization of the productivity improvements made possible through the “Division of Labour”: It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs.

Without a work computer, I had to resort to using my 7 year old 13" Macbook Pro as my main computer, and sometime last year my carpal tunnel syndrome returned with a vengeance and left my wrists debilitated with pain. I believe all of you who say your main computer is a laptop or, shudder, an iPad, but goodness gracious I cannot type on a compact keyboard for long periods of time without having my hands turn into useless stumps.

## Understanding Amazon

**Author:** Paul

**Link:** http://understandingamazon.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-growth-levers-in-retail-price.html

### AI-Generated Summary

Summary:
The article discusses the concept of 'growth levers' in retail, which are price, selection, and convenience. It explains how these levers can be manipulated by retailers to drive growth, but also highlights the trade-offs involved due to limited resources. The article uses Amazon's success as an example of effectively using these levers.

Key Insights:
- The three main growth levers in retail are price, selection, and convenience. Price refers to the cost of products, selection to the range of products offered, and convenience to the ease of the shopping experience.
- Retailers can push these levers to drive growth, but each requires an investment of resources such as capital, management attention, supply chain capabilities, and real estate.
- Due to limited resources, retailers must decide which lever to prioritize, leading to a game of priorities and compromise.
- The article uses examples of different retailers to illustrate how these levers can be manipulated. For instance, discount grocer Aldi prioritizes low prices, while Whole Foods focuses on a wide selection and high convenience.
- Amazon's success is attributed to its effective use of these growth levers, which is part of its feedback loop strategy.

Main Takeaways:
- Retailers should understand the concept of growth levers and how manipulating price, selection, and convenience can drive growth.
- It's crucial to consider the trade-offs involved in pushing each lever, as resources are limited.
- Retailers can learn from successful companies like Amazon on how to effectively use these growth levers.

Pages Home Resources The Growth Levers in Retail: Price, Selection, Convenience Amazon's Feedback Loop If we were forced to reduce the secret of Amazon's success to one simple concept, this would be it: Amazon churning hard on the Feedback Loop featured above. This is absolutely critical to understanding Amazon. And not just retail. I mean every business line it's in. So I'll dedicate several posts to breaking it down, and then building it back up again. Stick with me on this. It will be worth it. The Growth Levers in Retail: Price, Selection, Convenience In the world of retailing three variables are responsible for driving the lion’s share of growth. Price, Selection, and Convenience. Price is self-evident. When comparing apples to apples, customers want the lower-priced apple. Selection means the retailer offers the products the customer wants. And convenience means the shopping experience is streamlined, not confusing, not complex, and requires as little exertion from the customer as is humanly possible. Growth Levers in Retail Think of these variables as levers a retailer can push, but that pushing each lever requires an investment of capital and other resources (e.g., management attention, supply chain capabilities, real estate acquisition, etc.

### Original Summary

listen to the audio version of this article: This post is all about WeChat, but it’s also about more than just WeChat. While seemingly just a messaging app, WeChat is actually more of a portal, a platform, and even a mobile operating system depending on how you look at it. Much has been written about WeChat in the context of messaging app trends, but few outside of China really understand how it works — and how it can pull off what for many companies (and countries) is still a far-off vision of a world managed entirely through our smartphones. Many of WeChat’s most interesting features — such as access to city services — are not even visible to users outside China. So why should people outside of China even care about WeChat? The first and most obvious reason is that it points to where Facebook and other messaging apps could head. Second, WeChat indicates where the future of mobile commerce may lie. Third, WeChat shows what it’s like to be both a platform and a mobile portal (what Yahoo could have been).

### AI-Generated Summary

Summary:
The article is a review of Edward Tufte's book, "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information," which is considered a classic in data visualization. The author shares key takeaways from the book, discusses the history of data graphics, and highlights the importance of understanding data graphics in the current digital age.

Key Insights:
- The book emphasizes the principle of 'less is more' in data visualization, urging readers to show the data and erase everything unnecessary.
- Graphical excellence is defined as the communication of complex ideas with clarity, precision, and efficiency.
- The book advises keeping the 'Lie Factor' (the size of the effect shown in graphic divided by the size of effect in data) close to 1 to maintain proportionality.
- If there isn't much data, a table is often a better choice than a graphic.
- The book strongly discourages the use of pie charts in data visualization.
- The author was surprised to learn that data graphics are a relatively new development, emerging in the seventeenth century.
- Well-designed charts can inspire action, as demonstrated by John Snow's 1854 map that helped combat a cholera outbreak in London.
- Tufte self-published his book in 1982, taking a significant financial risk that ultimately paid off.

Main Takeaways:
- When creating data visualizations, focus on clarity, precision, and efficiency, and avoid unnecessary elements.
- Be mindful of the proportionality in data visualizations, keeping the 'Lie Factor' close to 1.
- Consider the type and amount of data before deciding on the format of visualization; sometimes, a table may be more effective than a graphic.

## Book Summary

**Author:** Readingraphics

**Link:** https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-the-innovators-solution/

### AI-Generated Summary

**Summary:**

The article is a comprehensive summary of the book "The Innovator’s Solution" by Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor. The book provides insights on how both startups and established companies can use disruptive innovations to create and maintain profitable growth. It addresses nine strategic questions that managers must grapple with to successfully maintain growth and leverage disruptive technology.

**Key Insights:**

- Most investors prioritize a company's rate of growth over its profits or assets. However, growth often plateaus once a company’s core business matures, making sustained growth difficult.
- The book presents two types of innovation: Sustaining innovation, which improves existing products for established markets, and disruptive innovation, which introduces new products for new markets.
- Disruptive innovation allows new entrants to penetrate a market and eventually establish a strong position. It often appeals to new or less-demanding customers with simpler, cheaper, and more convenient products.
- The authors suggest using circumstance-based segmentation instead of conventional segmentation by product or customer attributes to understand what customers want.
- The book also addresses questions related to identifying the best customers, deciding which activities to do in-house or outsource, how to stay profitable and avoid being commoditized, the best organizational structure for the new venture, how to develop effective business strategies, the best ways to fund the innovation, and the ideal role for the CEO and senior executives.

**Main Takeaways:**

- Companies should focus on disruptive innovation to create and maintain profitable growth. This involves introducing new products that offer greater simplicity and convenience at lower prices.
- Managers should use circumstance-based segmentation to understand what their customers want and design products accordingly.
- Companies should be strategic in deciding which activities to do in-house or outsource, based on their competitive circumstances and product architecture.
- To avoid being commoditized, companies should move to another part of the value chain where there’s still a performance gap in the sub-system and use interdependent integration to differentiate themselves.
- Senior executives should champion disruptive businesses and ensure the right resources, processes, and values are applied to the new business.

### Original Summary

Financial markets demand that companies deliver ever-faster growth. Yet, sustained growth is rare, especially once a business matures and growth flattens naturally. In this book, Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor explain how both startups and established companies can use disruptive innovations to systematically create and maintain profitable growth. In this free version of The Innovator’s Solution summary, you’ll learn the difference between sustaining and disruptive technologies, as well as the 9 strategic questions that managers must address to leverage disruptive technology for growth. Most investors care more about a company’s rate of growth than its profits or assets. Unfortunately, growth usually plateaus once a company’s core business matures, and few companies can sustain consistent, profitable growth. Once growth stops, it’s hard to pick up momentum again. Executives may try to develop new areas of growth, but this takes time and most new innovations fail. In fact, the pursuit of growth can lead to huge losses that cripple a company and destroy shareholder value. In fact, the pursuit of growth can lead to bad decisions that result in huge losses and cripple a company, destroying shareholder value.

Summary of Design Of Everyday Things by Don Norman.Ayodeji Olagbaiye9 min read·Sep 29, 2020--The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman(revised edition 2013) is a bok that considers the depth and range of interactions between people and the real world. The range of “things” is not just limited to physical objects, it includes any artificial creation: software and digital interfaces. I will breakdown my summary chapter by chapter.Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday ThingsIn this chapter, Don Norman talks about the most important characteristics of good design which are discoverability and understanding.Discoverability — Is it possible for users to figure out what the possible actions are to use that product?.Understandability — Is it possible[easy] for users to figure out how the product can be used, is the language clear enough?An example is a door; a door handle helps a user “discover” what action is possible, while a pull or push sign helps the user “understand” what to do with that door handle, which direction the user should push or pull it.

### Original Summary

Good afternoon. Today's speaker is Peter Thiel. Peter, was the founder of PayPal, and Palantir, and Founders Fund, and has invested in most of the tech companies in Silicon Valley. And he's going to talk about strategy and competition. Thank you for coming, Peter. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks, Sam. Thanks for inviting me. Thanks for having me. I sorta, I have a single a day fixed that I'm completely obsessed with in. On the business side which is that, if you're starting a company, if you're the founder, entrepreneur starting a company, you always want to aim for monopoly, and that you want to always avoid competition. Hence, competition is for losers. Something we'll be talking about today. I'd like to start by saying something about the basic idea of when you start one of these companies how you go about, creating value? And this question, what makes a business valuable? And I wanna, suggest that there's basically, a very simple very simple formula that you, have a valuable company two things are true. Number one, that it creates X dollars of value for the world. And number two, that you capture Y% of X.
