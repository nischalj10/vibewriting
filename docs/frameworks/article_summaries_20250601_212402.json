This does not mean every product that looks like a toy will turn out to be the next big thing. To distinguish toys that are disruptive from toys that will remain just toys, you need to look at products as processes. Obviously, products get better inasmuch as the designer adds features, but this is a relatively weak force. Much more powerful are external forces: microchips getting cheaper, bandwidth becoming ubiquitous, mobile devices getting smarter, etc. For a product to be disruptive it needs to be designed to ride these changes up the utility curve.

If you had gone back to 2001 and analyzed Wikipedia as a static product it would have looked very much like a toy. The reason Wikipedia works so brilliantly are subtle design features that sculpt the torrent of user edits such that they yield a net improvement over time. Since users’ needs for encyclopedic information remains relatively steady, as long as Wikipedia got steadily better, it would eventually meet and surpass user needs.

    "ai_summary": "1. Brief Summary:\nThe article discusses the concept of disruptive technologies, often initially dismissed as \"toys\", which eventually become the next big thing. It highlights how these technologies tend to improve at a faster rate than users' needs increase, leading to their eventual adoption and success. The author uses examples such as the telephone, personal computers, and Wikipedia to illustrate this concept.\n\n2. Key Insights:\n   - Disruptive technologies often start as products that are dismissed as \"toys\" because they initially undershoot user needs.\n   - These technologies improve at a faster rate than users' needs increase, leading to their eventual widespread adoption.\n   - Not all products that look like toys will become disruptive technologies. To distinguish between the two, it's important to view products as processes that improve over time.\n   - External forces, such as cheaper microchips, ubiquitous bandwidth, and smarter mobile devices, play a significant role in the improvement of these products.\n   - Social software, like Wikipedia, is a special case where the strongest forces of improvement are users' actions.\n\n3. Main Takeaways:\n   - When developing a product, consider the potential for it to be a disruptive technology by examining how it could improve over time and meet user needs.\n   - Pay attention to external forces that could enhance the utility and adoption of a product.\n   - In the case of social software, leverage the power of user actions to drive continuous improvement and value.",

Thus there is an opening to acquire customers, e.g. Snapchat started 2011 while Facebook started 2004Big company acquisitions — If a company is acquired for $5B+, consider a competitor. This may indicate product maturity, a departure of talent after earnouts, or becoming focused on profits vs. product investment. Now may be a great time to re-imaginge LinkedIn or GithubMarket validation from other startups — Find a company that recently raised a series A and approach solving the problem differently. Often the first company to identify an opportunity will not win but does indicate customers have a real problem they want solved.Revisit ideas that were too early — Look back at ideas that were hot 10 years ago because entrepreneurs have a tendency to be too early. See if any might make sense now, e.g. Instacart vs. Webvan.Invert a successful company’s core competency — Take the core strength of a company and flip it on its head to see what a product experience may be if you did the opposite, e.g. Snapchat was based on ephemerality and Facebook based on permanence of identity, or Southwest was based on a point-to-point model with only one type of plane whereas other airlines use a hub and spoke model with multiple types of planes.Extend consumer behaviors to businesses — Take a product used by consumers and think about how it might apply to prosumers, enterprises, and small businesses, e.g. LinkedIn vs Facebook.Turn open source projects in to SAAS businesses — Find open source projects that are very popular and turn these in to out of the box services for enterprises, e.g. PagerDuty is like Nagios.Compete with old world industries using software — Find an industry that is resistant to using software and build a vertically integrated version to compete with that industry, e.g. Atrium vs. law firms.Low NPS, fragmented industries — Identify a large, a highly-fragmented industry with terrible net-promoter-score and build a modern, software-first version of their product, e.g. OpenDoor (credit to Keith Rabois for this one) Make things programmable — Take a desktop utility, move it online, and make it more powerful by making it more programmable, e.g. Airtable and Notion (similar to Elad Gil’s idea around devsumers)Unbundle a company — Look at the functions of modern companies and unbundle them to make them available for companies of all sizes, e.g. WeWork is the unbundled facilities group at most big companiesLook to engineers’ hobbies — Figure out where hobbyist engineers are spending their spare time and how to productize that (Chris Dixon’s idea)Understand how teens communicate — Figure out where teenagers are spending their time to see what the communication products of the next decade may be. Teens are unencumbered and very creative, so seek to understand the motivations instead of judge.Travel and observe non-software solutions — Travel to new places to discover non-software solutions that other countries/people/markets have come up with to various problems, e.g. I was in Moscow in 2006 and people could just hail any stranger on the street to drive them somewhere like a cab. It may not have been a big leap if you saw this behavior to Uber/Lyft on your phone.Look at behaviors in certain geographies — Smaller, homogenous culture countries (Sweden, Korea, Japan) are early adopters of many technologies. Spend time there to understand what they are doing that isn’t globally popular yet, e.g. watching other people play video games or mobile payments took off in these markets very early relative to the US.Unbundle the government — Think about what services the government offers and how you might build a profitable business model around these, perhaps even by offering these services in a more cost-effective way back to the government, e.g. SpaceX is a private NASA, FedEx is a private postal service.Verticalize an already successful business — Find a massively successful business such as Salesforce and target it for a vertical that is traditionally challenging to access, e.g. Veeva is a pharma industry specific CRM worth $15B+ and raised only $7M in funding.Build something for a distribution channel — Identify a new distribution channel that would enable access to a new customer, and then think through what that customer wants that the distribution channel does not want to provide, e.g. Pinterest and Yelp built on SEO, Paypal built on eBay, YouTube embedded inside MySpace before MySpace had a video product.Draft on a regulatory shift — Build behind a big regulatory shift to compete with large incumbents who will be slow to move and have regulatory + technical baggage, e.g. Oscar Health after Obamacare. I’m sure some companies will spin up to help people transition to a post-GDPR world. I’m sure there are other good heuristics to use as a starting point. If anyone sends me others, I’ll add them to my blog post as a reference for others.\n\nThese heuristics are just a starting point to identify interesting, unsolved problems in the world that may turn in to great startups.

Teens are unencumbered and very creative, so seek to understand the motivations instead of judge.\n\nTravel and observe non-software solutions — Travel to new places to discover non-software solutions that other countries/people/markets have come up with to various problems, e.g. I was in Moscow in 2006 and people could just hail any stranger on the street to drive them somewhere like a cab. It may not have been a big leap if you saw this behavior to Uber/Lyft on your phone.\n\nLook at behaviors in certain geographies — Smaller, homogenous culture countries (Sweden, Korea, Japan) are early adopters of many technologies. Spend time there to understand what they are doing that isn’t globally popular yet, e.g. watching other people play video games or mobile payments took off in these markets very early relative to the US.\n\nUnbundle the government — Think about what services the government offers and how you might build a profitable business model around these, perhaps even by offering these services in a more cost-effective way back to the government, e.g. SpaceX is a private NASA, FedEx is a private postal service.\n\nVerticalize an already successful business — Find a massively successful business such as Salesforce and target it for a vertical that is traditionally challenging to access, e.g. Veeva is a pharma industry specific CRM worth $15B+ and raised only $7M in funding.\n\nBuild something for a distribution channel — Identify a new distribution channel that would enable access to a new customer, and then think through what that customer wants that the distribution channel does not want to provide, e.g. Pinterest and Yelp built on SEO, Paypal built on eBay, YouTube embedded inside MySpace before MySpace had a video product.\n\nDraft on a regulatory shift — Build behind a big regulatory shift to compete with large incumbents who will be slow to move and have regulatory + technical baggage, e.g. Oscar Health after Obamacare. I’m sure some companies will spin up to help people transition to a post-GDPR world.\n\nI’m sure there are other good heuristics to use as a starting point. If anyone sends me others, I’ll add them to my blog post as a reference for others.\n\nView all posts by avichal",

    "ai_summary": "Summary:\nThe article provides a set of heuristics for generating startup ideas, emphasizing the need for entrepreneurs to identify unsolved problems and understand their customers and business model. The author suggests various strategies such as leveraging tools used in big companies, considering consumer generation shifts, revisiting ideas that were previously too early, and extending consumer behaviors to businesses. \n\nKey Insights:\n- High growth companies often solve problems internally that other companies will soon face. These solutions can be turned into successful startups.\n- Consumer tastes and platforms evolve every 7-10 years, providing opportunities for new startups to acquire customers.\n- Startups can approach problems differently than companies that have recently raised a Series A round, indicating that customers have a real problem they want solved.\n- Ideas that were too early a decade ago may be viable now.\n- Consumer behaviors can be extended to prosumers, enterprises, and small businesses, creating new business opportunities.\n\nMain Takeaways:\n- Entrepreneurs should focus on identifying problems rather than generating ideas that sound good.\n- Look at successful companies and consider how their core competencies could be inverted to create a new product experience.\n- Consider turning popular open source projects into SAAS businesses for enterprises.\n- Identify industries resistant to using software and build a vertically integrated version to compete with them.\n- Observe behaviors in certain geographies, especially in smaller, homogenous culture countries that are early adopters of many technologies.",

You can replace a CEO, you can alter a product roadmap, you can tweak a marketing message. But it is impossible to fix market size, so do the back-of-the-envelope math upfront and aim big.Your product has to solve one of the top three biggest problems your customer is facing. If it’s a nice-to-have, it just won’t cut it. A dangerous trap awaits you here: if you’re solving problem #10 for someone, you’re in trouble. Sure, you’ll get good feedback from your customers — “yes, this is a problem that I have!” — but you’ll be sad and frustrated when no one buys your product, because they’re never going to get around to solving problem #10. (If I get through priorities #1 and #2 on a given day, I’m feeling really great about myself. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten to priority #5.)Fortunately, there’s a cheat code: if you solve one of your own hair-on-fire problems and there are lots of people like you in the world, you’ll be in good shape. (This is actually how the idea for Pilot came about: we wanted to solve a problem we struggled with at our previous companies.)One of two things needs to be true about your product: your user either needs to be able to pick it up and start using it immediately with no training, or you ask your user to change their workflow but the benefit is visible in the first sixty seconds.An example of the first option: You get behind the wheel of an electric car and start driving. It works just like the car you’re already used to — and it’s quieter and you can charge it at home.An example of the second option: It’s 2010 and you’re upgrading from your BlackBerry to an iPhone (yes, this is a vintage example). You’re losing the keyboard you know and love, but you’re sold on the better web browser and all the apps, so you’re willing to endure the learning curve.What you cannot do is ask people to change their workflow and not immediately present the payoff. There can be no delayed gratification. People are busy. They don’t want to spend time learning your product or doing things differently unless you show them clearly and quickly why their life will be better if they do.If you’re solving an important problem for people, they should be willing to pay you for it. The price of your product is also a proxy for how valuable it is. Broadly, if your product is expensive it means that you’re solving a real problem for your users.Separately, price matters much more than you might think. It affects everything about your business: how you position it, how you can market it, how you can sell it, how you can support it, etc. For example, if your product costs $5/month, you can’t afford to hire someone to pick up the phone and sell it — you have to sell it online in a self-service way, because the economics don’t support any other approach. But if your product is more expensive, you can still sell it online in a self-service way, but you can also employ a sales team, etc.In short, when possible, it’s better to solve an expensive problem because it gives you more flexibility.Your life will be easiest if your product is a better version of something people are already paying for. If you’re entering an existing market, people already know how to think about your product, and there’s already a line-item in their budget for solving the problem. You don’t have to convince people that your problem is worth solving — you simply have to convince them that your solution is better than whatever they’re using today.If you’re creating a brand new category, you have three challenges: (1) you have to make your customer aware of the problem you’re solving, (2) you need to convince them to spend money to solve it, and (3) they need to convince their boss to give them money to solve it.In fairness: if you can successfully create a brand new category, you can fully own it — that’s awesome and very value-creating. But it’s also super-hard; it’s much easier if there’s room in the budget for the thing you sell.Searching for your next idea is a painful and challenging process — and truthfully, it’s one of the parts I’ve least enjoyed about starting a company. There are two things that make it especially painful: (1) it’s exhausting to just think of ideas for 8 hours a day, and (2) for every idea you come up with, it’s easy to come up with tons of reasons why it won’t work. (This is unfortunately true for both your good ideas and bad ideas.)The best antidote I’ve found is: once you have a promising idea, get out there and pressure-test it with potential customers. The mere act of talking to other people about your idea will feel good, and you’ll learn a lot.Here’s the thing: No matter how much work you do, your idea will never feel quite perfect — and that’s okay.

    "ai_summary": "1. Brief Summary:\nThe article by Waseem Daher, a startup founder, provides advice for entrepreneurs based on his experiences. He emphasizes the importance of targeting a large market, solving a top problem for customers, ensuring the product is easy to use or provides immediate benefits, pricing the product appropriately, and entering an existing market or creating a new category. He also discusses the challenges of idea generation and the need to pressure-test ideas with potential customers.\n\n2. Key Insights:\n   - The size of the market targeted by a startup is crucial as it provides more room for growth and success, and unlike other issues, market size cannot be fixed later.\n   - A startup's product should solve one of the top three problems faced by customers, not a minor issue, and should be either easy to use or provide immediate benefits.\n   - The price of a product is a proxy for its value, and it influences various aspects of the business, including positioning, marketing, selling, and support.\n   - It's easier to succeed if the product is an improved version of something people are already paying for, as it eliminates the need to convince people about the problem's importance.\n   - Idea generation can be a challenging process, but it's important to pressure-test promising ideas with potential customers.\n\n3. Main Takeaways:\n   - When planning a startup, aim for a large market to ensure room for growth and success.\n   - Ensure your product solves a significant problem for customers and provides immediate benefits or is easy to use.\n   - Price your product appropriately, considering its value and the impact on business operations.\n   - If possible, improve on an existing product or service that people are already paying for to reduce the need for convincing customers about the problem's importance.\n   - Pressure-test your ideas with potential customers to gain feedback and insights.",

In other words, if you want to find the next great startup idea, you can’t wait for the proverbial lightbulb moment — you have to do your homework.\n\nAs we’ve said, before a founder starts building their castle, they have to make sure they’ve picked the right piece of land. To help aspiring builders survey potential plots, we’ve gone back through our archives to surface the best advice from first-time entrepreneurs and repeat-founders. The 12 tactics they share here offer more concrete tips for reverse-engineering these fabled eureka moments, whether you’re in the wide-open ideation phase, or contemplating a hyper-specific direction.\n\nThis collection of advice contains frameworks for brainstorming, questions to help pressure test concepts, and even thoughts on how to best explore a new idea with a potential co-founder. Whether you choose to adopt just one, or a combination of them all, we hope they’ll help you accelerate on your course to finding the right problem to solve and diving into the work of starting up.\n\nSTART WITH THE RIGHT MINDSET:\n\n1. Put more effort into problem selection than you think you need to.\n\nWhen it comes to the problem-selection phase of finding startup ideas, Ayo Omojola has plenty of experiences to tap into. He’s currently the VP of Product at Carbon Health, was the founding PM on the banking team for Cash App at Square, previously founded a YC-backed startup and actively angel invests — all of which adds up to a unique lens for finding and evaluating startup ideas.\n\n“When it comes to a new idea, it’s so much more important to be certain, or as sure as possible, that the questions you’re answering are worth asking to begin with,” he says. “When I think back to my last company, I was co-founders with my brother and a friend. We picked a problem to tackle that we found really technically interesting. We cranked for years and worked so hard and it just didn’t matter,” he says.\n\n“The lesson I took from it was that we had put so much effort into the actual work, and had not put nearly enough effort into choosing what to work on. That was a much bigger determinant to our outcome — we hadn’t chosen a large enough market. If you pick a big domain that’s rich with opportunity, it of course matters how hard you work, but you also get so much more leverage.”\n\nOmojola pinpoints how this grind-it-out mindset might be a product of our school days. “What we’re taught when we grow up is that our outcome is 100% correlated to our effort. If I study hard for a test or work hard on a project, I’m going to get a better grade than if I don’t try. So I’ve always just assumed that when things aren’t going well, I just need to work harder,” he says.\n\nChoosing a problem that matters, even if your work is average, will generally yield a better outcome than choosing a terrible problem, even if your work is excellent.\n\n“Doing a startup isn’t a sound financial decision. Logically, the odds are so stacked against you that it doesn't make any sense. Jumping into life as a founder is a romantic decision. It's the kind of move you make when you want some adventure,” says Punit Soni. “But that doesn’t mean you have to leap off a cliff. Starting a company is like climbing a steep mountain — you need to take the time to prepare your pack.”\n\nPart of the preparation includes keeping your mindset in check before you even set off. “You have to put a lot of intellectual vigor into figuring out exactly what you want to do. You need to carve out time specifically for that task by reading up, doing diligence, exploring different spaces,” says Soni. “It’s just like getting into a top school or amazing company. If you want the chance to start your own company, work for it — don’t wait to get inspired.”\n\nSoni eventually landed on the idea that became Suki (a voice-based digital assistant for doctors) — but here’s a vignette of the work that went into unearthing it. Soni wanted to start a healthcare company, but he didn’t have much direction beyond that. “I had zero experience in healthcare, so I spent six months just shadowing doctors and embedding myself in large health systems to learn what kind of issues they were facing,” he says. “Nothing replaces in-person observation as a tool for figuring out both go-to-market and product.”\n\nAt one point, he thought he might have a winner. “It was essentially what Slack did for healthcare. There’s so much communication in a hospital, it seemed like there was a desperate need for it. And I knew I could build a great consumer product,” Soni says.\n\nOver lunch in the break room with a group of nurses, he pitched his big idea. \"They looked at me and said, 'Punit, I use a fax machine, pagers, Microsoft Outlook, electronic medical records, and paper documents on top of that. I will not use another communication protocol. In fact, if I see anybody else using it, I’ll actively try to stop them,” Soni says.\n\nThe criticism stung, but it was revealing. “It was an idea that I was personally very excited about. But it's an example of how you need to understand what the user is going through when you’re coming up with these Silicon Valley ideas to solve their problems,” says Soni.\n\n“You have to spend the time asking a lot of questions and truly listening, but also translating. Most users don't necessarily know what they want, but they do know what's hurting them. It's your job as an entrepreneur to convert what's hurting them into a product.”\n\nIf you’re open to having your ideas challenged, you'll have a far greater chance of creating the product that your users actually want — not the one you think they want.\n\nBLUE-SKY BRAINSTORM:\n\n3. Set your compass with these three questions.\n\nWhen you’re starting out with a completely blank slate, it can seem like you’re at an intersection with infinite pathways. Sasha Orloff knows the feeling. After founding and scaling LendUp for seven years, he decided to step down as CEO — without anything solid lined up. In the hiatus that followed, he took 100 coffee chats with founders, CEOs and investors to gather advice for his next move. Of course, one option was obvious — finding another entrepreneurial itch to scratch as a repeat founder.\n\n“When you’re a founder, you’ve proven that you’re capable of creating something, and that’s really exciting. Becoming a serial entrepreneur is a way to keep creating,” says Orloff. “But fear of the ‘sophomore slump’ was acute among founders who left and started another company. And I admit that, no matter how many times people told me not to pay attention to those irrational fears and insecurities, I felt it too. For my next venture, I obviously wanted to create something that’s bigger and has a larger impact than my first — and that’s intimidating to say out loud.”\n\nWhether you’re a first-timer or on your second or third bite at the apple, Orloff suggests finding direction as you search for a stroke of inspiration by asking yourself a simple series of questions:\n\nWhere are the big problem areas in the world?\n\nWhat personal skills, advantages or insights do you have to be able to help solve it?\n\nHow can you turn this into a viable business idea?\n\nOrloff gives an example of how he thought through this framework: “During my time off, I was exploring how I could apply my background in entrepreneurship, technology, and experience with working-class Americans to democratize access and improve their lives,” he says. “If you’ve been thinking about a business idea for a long time, and repeatedly, it’s a good sign that you are passionate about it and should at least explore moving forward with it in some capacity.”\n\n4. Hunt for ideas in nonobvious markets.\n\nThe trick to spotting a nonobvious idea lies in finding what bucks conventional wisdom before anyone else and scaling that unlikely idea into a high-growth company — something investor, operator, and High Growth Handbook author Elad Gil is very familiar with. To help potential founders find and mine nonobvious markets, Gil buckets the best types to go after: new technology, looks crowded but isn’t, and seemingly niche.\n\n“From mobile to social to crypto, there’s so many examples where people failed to imagine what a couple years of compounding developments would look like, in terms of technology speed improving, costs dropping or adoption increasing,” he says.\n\n“We should be monitoring what’s compounding at a fast rate, or alternatively, where adoption is growing reasonably rapidly. The proof is in the growth rate or the extrapolated technology curve rather than the number sitting in front of you in that moment. You can also look at the technology and ask ‘Well, how much faster or better is this thing getting per year?’ and then look downstream. Or go the opposite way and ask ‘What happens if instead of a million people doing this thing, you had 50 million? What fundamentally changes in the market?’”\n\nLooks crowded but isn’t:\n\n“A busy market isn’t a negative signal in and of itself. If you do some poking around, you may find that it’s actually quite empty, whether that’s because no one has a great product or there’s lots of players with little differentiation,” he says.\n\nYou can still win even if someone else gets there first. Dig deeper to find differentiation and capture what they’re leaving on the table.\n\nGiven that many of the most interesting markets always look crowded, Gil offers a series of questions to hunt for signals of open space:\n\nSize up the competition. Are the competitors any good? Is it a great team than can crank out fast follows? How strong is their brand? “Many good ideas have bad implementations, so if you can come in strong and do it well you can win,” says Gil.\n\nLook for structural disadvantages. Are there unfair distribution mechanisms or other barriers? “Some crowded markets are indeed crowded or not worth it. Selling niche software tools to big pharma is an example, because there is just a small number of customers. Edtech is another area where I think it’s tough to gain traction,” says Gil. “Same with IoT. Large enterprises have a significant advantage because they can integrate and distribute, as opposed to a startup that makes a single ‘smart’ device, which doesn’t scale.”\n\nSuss out if there’s room. Is it a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market? Or is it more of an oligopoly structure? “You need to measure how much room there is. People often think it’s ‘game over,’ which if you look at things like payments, isn’t always the case,” he says.\n\nCalculate potential customers. Are customers actually being served well? What's the total penetration versus what it should be? How many people are actually utilizing the product and what is the true potential? “These questions can uncover that the incumbent product isn’t great,” says Gil. “Part of the reason Dropbox spread is because there was a real need there. If you think about it, the total population that should be using cloud storage solutions is close to all of the people who are online and using files. If you did the math before Dropbox came on the scene and looked at how many people were actually using a certain provider versus how many people should have been using cloud storage, you would have seen that the numbers were way off. It can be a quick back of the napkin calculation,” he says.\n\nSeems niche:\n\nWhen determining how big a market can get, founders and investors often delude themselves — in both directions. “Sometimes it’s not niche, it’s just boring. If you conflate the two, you’ll miss out on incredible opportunities,” he says. For Gil, there are four types here that warrant a second look:\n\nToo small: “I’ve heard so many investors say ‘Yeah, there's real uses there, but it's too small to go anywhere,’” says Gil. “But ‘small’ can easily turn into a mainstream product. I remember when Uber first got funded, a lot of the conversations were ‘They’ll only get 20% of the taxi market which is tiny.’ And in hindsight, Uber was actually solving a pretty dramatic user experience problem around transportation.”\n\nToo boring: “There are some real opportunities in areas where investors or founders essentially don’t want to think about it or they just don’t understand it. Some things like payroll aren’t very exciting,” says Gil. “PagerDuty is also one of my favorite examples. A signal for founders might be if you or your friends keep building the same internal tools over and over again. If it’s boring, just go do it, because that can become an advantage.”\n\nToo high-end: “You also hear that certain ideas are super high-end and can’t possibly scale. But you have to see the bigger picture and think about where it could go,” says Gil. “How else could it be applied or who else could be served if costs came down with scale? Think of Tesla when it was just the Roadster or how Uber’s initial pitch deck was focused on black cars.”\n\nToo personally unfamiliar: “As a founder, you should go with what you know, even though others may not get it — it'll be less crowded. For example, Katrina Lake turned Stitch Fix into a multi-billion dollar company. Emily Weiss founding Glossier is another awesome example. Male entrepreneurs may not have thought of these markets and investors might have overlooked their potential, but Katrina and Emily knew there was white space,” says Gil. “Drawing on your own experiences or getting diverse perspectives is a key tool for figuring out if an opportunity is really niche or if it just appears that way and is a massive market instead.”\n\n5. Relax your constraints on the current reality.\n\nAs a professor, former CEO, longtime investor, and co-founder of First Round Capital, Howard Morgan has seen one habit differentiate good founders from great founders: the ability to relax constraints.\n\nIf you can’t think out of the box, make the box bigger. Start by relaxing constraints.\n\nMorgan has seen both seasoned and green founders constrain their big idea from the get-go. But at ideation, it’s important to not limit yourself to the current reality — don’t be shy to engage in truly futuristic thinking.\n\nStart with the technical. To build something that will change how people live their lives, you need to think beyond what’s available today. “When we were building internet companies at Idealab in '96 through 2000, the bandwidth that was available to most people was 56k dial-up. But to build interesting user interfaces, you had to assume broadband,” says Morgan. “Likewise, mobile bandwidth on 2G was not enough to do interesting data. So successful developers imagined away that constraint. “They said, ‘What if that goes away? We can build GPS. We can build rich applications that need hundreds of megabits per second.’\"\n\nWhen it comes to developing solutions to previously unsolvable problems, founders will also come up against the limitation of what is currently known, or knowable. But when relaxing knowledge constraints, it’s still important to observe the laws of physics. “We’re not likely to change those, so antigravity or perpetual motion machines should not be part of your plan,” says Morgan. “You should also understand that what may be known in 50 years is not that relevant to today’s startup. Thinking three to 10 years out is about as far as one should go for almost any founder building a company.”\n\nAs you consider startup ideas, here are several questions that might help you cast off these constraints:\n\nWhat technology is missing that is stopping you from achieving your end goal?\n\nWhat can you do now that lets you fold your more ambitious aims in later?\n\nWhat’s the science fiction version of your product?\n\nHave you pondered any particularly intriguing “What ifs?”\n\nWhen hiring teams to build groundbreaking technology, ask: What's the closest analog to what I want to do? Where can I find those people to relax that constraint?\n\nSHARPEN YOUR VISION:\n\n6. Take two weeks to tackle a hands-on project.\n\nAfter leaving Stripe to start what eventually became Siteline, Gloria Lin was laser focused on finding the right fit — both in terms of a co-founder and the idea they would be tackling together. “People get hung up on having either a solid company idea or a specific co-founder in place from the start, but I don’t think you need either right away,” she says. “See the white space as an opportunity to try working together and a chance to explore interesting ideas at the same time.”\n\nWe recommend taking her advice here. Her playbook for finding a co-founder is one of the most detailed and intentional processes we’ve ever seen — and the set of 50 questions she used to probe compatibility is an essential tool for founding duos. (We focus on Step 3 of her process here, but be sure to read her full approach.)\n\nWhen it comes to starting a company, you can figure out the right space to go after and find the right person to tackle it with in parallel. Don’t compromise on either.\n\nAfter spot checking for initial alignment with a potential co-founder, Lin dives straight into tackling a project together. “Dive into exploring specific ideas with brainstorming and lightweight prototyping. The goal is to both make progress toward an idea and gain collaboration experience to see what it would be like to work together,” says Lin. “The first or second coffee chat may not tell you that much. But once you start doing some kind of project, you get so much more data on the person and their work style,” she says.\n\n“For me, this was the fun part. It’s about getting your hands dirty, digging into a space, figuring out the need, and seeing if a startup idea has potential,” says Lin. “It’s also an opportunity to uncover if you’re actually interested in a certain area. A few times I thought I was passionate about a certain industry, only to discover through hands-on projects that I actually didn’t enjoy it.”\n\nIt’s not about tinkering aimlessly, though. Lin suggests timeboxing this exploratory period to about two weeks to maximize both learning fast and moving quickly. As for how to approach this period of exploration, her advice for consumer and enterprise startup ideas differs. When investigating a consumer play with a potential co-founder, Lin is a firm believer that you have to try to build something. “It doesn't mean that you have to build a full production-ready app. Figure out the cheapest possible thing, the crappiest MVP you can get out there within a week or two just to see how things go,” says Lin. “That could be a really janky prototype, a small Chrome extension, or a landing page. Anything where you can put it out into the world and see if there’s a response.”\n\nContrast that with enterprise, which is more about customer discovery. “With enterprise, building often isn’t the hard part. It’s all about selling. You need a shortcut to figure out, ‘Am I making something people want?’ Do a bunch of interviews with experts or potential customers to find out. Customers will tell you what their problems are. If you listen very carefully, you might be able to figure out a jumping off point to build a company around.” Here’s a sampling of the specific questions Lin and her potential co-founders asked in these customer calls:\n\nHow do you currently manage this process?\n\nHow big of a pain point is it for you, compared to other pain points you have?\n\nIf you could wave a magic wand and have that problem go away, how would that affect your work or your customers?\n\nWhen you’re exploring enterprise startup ideas, you have to get out and talk to customers. My co-founder and I got ideas from those conversations that I could have never come up with on my own in a million years.\n\n7. Don’t be afraid to let your idea simmer for a while.\n\n“I see so many founders starting companies saying ‘There’s an opportunity in this space somewhere, I’ll find it.’ Or, I've known kids just out of school who announce that they’re ‘off to do a startup.’ That might work out eventually, but it’s a hard thing to do because there’s no clear path,” says Lloyd Tabb.\n\n“I waited a really long time to start Looker. Looking back, I think we had a lot of success because I waited until I had a crisp thesis on what the problem was — and then we went directly at it. I may not have been sure how I was going to achieve it, but I was clear on what the mission was from the jump: to build a product that lets everyone in the organization see everything that’s happening, through data.\"\n\nFuture founders, start with a really strong thesis on the problem you’re going to tackle. If you’re missing that first crucial ingredient, it’s best to keep your company building dreams on a low simmer while you work to figure one out.\n\nThat thesis took root in Tabb’s previous experiences. “I’d seen the need for a product like Looker over several years and kept returning to the idea. After playing founding roles at multiple companies, I knew that businesses needed a real-time understanding of their data. I was always building these one-off, custom tools to help others look at very narrow, specific datasets and I realized that there had to be a much better way of doing this,” he says. “If you’re building the same thing over and over again, that’s a signal that there might be a startup idea in there.”\n\n8. Focus on the best jobs to tackle.\n\nAfter grad school at Stanford, Sunita Mohanty found herself in the middle of her first startup, a failing K-12 analytics company. “We were stuck in circles of decision-making and couldn’t successfully execute or build traction. Looking back, it’s easy to diagnose that we had a hard time focusing on which problem to solve first because we didn’t understand the actual problems of our audience well enough — we only assumed we did,” she says.\n\nNow in her work as an angel investor and advisor (in addition to her day-job as Product Lead as a part of Facebook's New Product Experimentation) she sees teams run into this very same brick wall, and always dishes out the same advice: “Do the work to make sure you are building a product that people will actually find valuable. That requires an incredibly deep understanding of the user, their hopes, and their motivations, instead of taking the easier path of operating off of untested assumptions.”\n\nThe bottom line is that you can very easily build something, but to increase your chance of creating something that is solving a real problem you need to be more rigorous in your approach.\n\nTo add that dose of rigor to her own work, Mohanty has come to rely on the JTBD (jobs-to-be-done) framework. (We’re just highlighting the relevant bits here, but for an excellent primer that’s tailored to the startup context, be sure to read her full JTBD guide on The Review.)\n\nMore specifically, Mohanty leans on jobs to be done statements, which concisely describe the way a particular product or service fits into a person's life to help them achieve a particular task, goal, or outcome that was previously unachievable. She shares the JBTD statement template that she finds helpful and is commonly used amongst Facebook and Instagram product teams:\n\nWhen I…… (context)\n\nBut…… (barrier)\n\nHelp me…. (goal)\n\nSo I….. (outcome)\n\nBut of course, there are many customer goals your product could tackle, so focus is paramount here. “From user interviews, look for themes that emerge in jobs to be done. You can also run surveys that ask users to rank the importance of jobs and how well each job currently is served by another app or product to gain a better understanding of the market opportunity. This can help you to narrow down jobs and prioritize those with the most demand and the largest gap to be filled,” she says.\n\nMohanty likes to use this framework when thinking about which jobs to tackle:\n\n9. Get super specific.\n\nBob Moore's first brush with life as a founder started in 2008 — three days before Lehman Brothers collapsed. Since cutting his teeth as a first-time founder in turbulent times, he's gone on to build two other companies. \"The difference between having a crisp vision and muddling through without one will alter the trajectory of your company — I’ve been on both sides of that coin,” he says.\n\nHere’s his advice for future founders hoping to come down on the right side: “Plain and simple, here’s the formula you need to nail down: Here's what we’re here to do, here’s why we'll be the best at doing this very specific thing, and here are the tailwinds that make now the right time to do it,” says Moore.\n\n“We’re seeing this now at my current startup, Crossbeam. We started this company with an extremely specific vision for what the world should look like when this data collaboration problem is solved in the best possible way, not with something generic like ‘Partnerships are a pain, let’s go figure that out.’”\n\nWhat are we going to do? What is our unique vision behind it? That’s an existential, table-stakes prerequisite to building a resilient venture-scale company. Even with the best team in the best market, you’ll hit a ceiling without these ingredients.\n\nEVALUATE IF AN IDEA HAS LEGS:\n\n10. Pressure test your idea against these four dimensions.\n\n“Aside from choosing your co-founder, identifying the right market to go after the single most important decision a founder makes, and it’s one too many get wrong,” says Todd Jackson. As a partner at First Round, Jackson has tons of patterns from his career to pull from here. He’s been an exec at Dropbox, a PM at Google and Facebook, and a founder himself (of Cover, an Android startup acquired by Twitter in 2014).\n\nOne pitfall is that product managers-turned-founders tend to dive straight into execution mode. “They think of an idea, move quickly to building a prototype and then sometimes momentum and the excitement of building takes over. While the operational focus and pure execution that you picked up as a PM are huge strengths, you’re better off first taking a step back and thinking about whether the market you’ve chosen and the problem you’re solving is big enough,” he says.\n\nBut how exactly can you size up if a startup idea is worth pursuing? When Jackson left Facebook in 2012, he ran into the very same question. “My co-founder Ed Ho and I knew we wanted to do a startup. We knew we worked well together from our time at Google, and that we were really interested in the same consumer spaces. But what we ended up pursuing — what became Cover for Android — was actually our third idea,” Jackson says.\n\n“Our first idea was in the sports space. We designed some things, talked to a bunch of entrepreneurs who had done sports related stuff and we realized that it was a hard market to compete in. Our second idea was a photo sharing app. At the time, Instagram was popular but not dominant, and Snap barely existed. There were still a lot of interesting things I think to be done there, but ultimately we were talked out of it by investors who were like, ‘Even if this is the next great photo app, how are you going to convince anyone of that? Not just users, but the engineers you need to recruit and so on.’”\n\nTo pressure test ideas like these (and the one that eventually one out), Jackson and his co-founders relied on the following framework — one that he still coaches future founders through to this day. If you’re an aspiring founder (or just keep a running list of company ideas in your Notes app) assess startup ideas against the following criteria:\n\nFunctional needs: Does it address a clear functional need that users have? This is often why they’ll try it.\n\nEmotional needs: Does it address an emotional need that users have? This is often why they’ll tell others about it, unlocking that viral word-of-mouth growth loop that’s so critical.\n\nBillion-plus market: Is it in a large, underserved market? Or in a market that can become large? This impacts everything from your ability to fundraise to who may be interested in acquiring you.\n\nBreakthrough UX: Is there something novel or unique about the user experience? Does it feel a little like magic when you use it? This last one isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s very helpful, and a lot of successful products had it when they launched.\n\n“Most founders I talk with haven't thought about their idea this deeply. They have a high-level problem they want to solve, but haven't yet mapped it to the functional and emotional needs of their customers. This exercise forces you to name the needs, and then pressure test whether those needs are acute or if they're just nice-to-haves,” says Jackson.\n\nIf you think of ideas that simultaneously meet people's functional needs and emotional needs, while sitting in a big market and making use of a breakthrough user interface, that’s a recipe for a really good company.\n\n11. Start pitching, but learn to sort through all the feedback.\n\n“Write what you know” is a common piece of writing advice. Likewise, founders hear some variation that tells them to tackle problems they’ve experienced firsthand. Nat Turner has a different approach, and it’s worked twice before — with his first company, Invite Media, which was snapped up by Google in 2010, and with Flatiron Health, which was acquired by Roche in 2018 for $1.9 billion (both of which he started with his co-founder Zach Weinberg).\n\nTurner’s entire process can be condensed into these key steps. Most crucially, instead of just researching the idea, or talking casually with others in the space, he immediately starts pitching — not to get investment, but to get feedback.\n\nBegin with a general space of interest and look for any seed of an idea\n\nNetwork like crazy in the industry and take introductions extremely seriously\n\nCreate a deck and start pitching anyone smart and relevant you can find on the specific idea - and be sure to take meticulous notes and follow up\n\nTweak the deck between every meeting and hack together a demo and start pitching (pre-sell software that doesn’t exist yet but will)\n\nFind a trusted group of advisors to discuss key learnings from the field and get feedback\n\nContinue to iterate as hard and fast as possible on the feedback you’ve received\n\nTurner recounts the early days of Invite Media: “We pitched everyone. We pitched potential advisors, investors, potential customers, friends, everyone. I can remember hundreds of meetings we had.” After beginning to pitch the idea, Turner and Weinberg and their two other co-founders built a demo as fast as possible, as people have an easier time reacting to a product than an abstract concept. After endless meetings of pitching a video ad creation product, the feedback they received began to form a pattern that they could act on.\n\nWhen Turner and Weinberg assessed an idea, they looked for a few key characteristics:\n\nCan this be a big business? Does the opportunity to build a billion dollar company exist in this space?\n\nIs this sustainable? Can this idea become sticky and last for a while?\n\nHow scalable is this? How well does this business scale and how does this grow nonlinearly?\n\n“Within four months of our initial video ad creation idea, we realized that it was going to be really hard, based on talking with people, to get enough ad inventory and to scale the demand,” Turner noted. They then built a Facebook app related to advertising and pitched it to more people, which after another round of feedback morphed into a universal buying platform for display advertising.\n\nThey began the process of building Flatiron the same way as they built Invite: by picking a generally interesting area, in this case health. Turner elaborates, “Our first idea was a second opinion site, and the second idea was a clinical trial matching tool, and the third idea was a business intelligence tool.”\n\nThe challenge with this approach of intensive pitching and listening is you get a tremendous amount of feedback. The market will tell you lots of things: some right, and some wrong. It’s your job as an entrepreneur to separate the signal from the noise. Turner explains, “If you're going to be successful as an entrepreneur, the biggest thing is being able to take in conflicting feedback from all these people, many of whom are jaded or have bad habits, and some who are spot on. You have to be able to sit there and distill that information into something valuable.”\n\nThe hard part isn’t coming up with ideas; it's distilling all the information you have, 90% of which will be crap, and finally figuring out what is the good 10%, recognizing that the good 10% may change rapidly depending on the industry.\n\n12. Take your own temperature.\n\nWhen he started Bowery Farming in 2014, Irving Fain had never worked in agriculture before. While he may have been new to the indoor farming space, he wasn’t a stranger to the twists and turns of being a CEO and founder. After helping build up iHeartRadio, he struck out to co-found CrowdTwist in 2009 — which assembled big logos founders would dream of like Pepsi, Sony Music, and the Miami Dolphins. But the company’s success wasn’t enough to keep Fain energized by enterprise software, and he left as CEO in 2014 (CrowdTwist would eventually be acquired by Oracle in 2019).\n\nThat’s why in the earliest days of spinning up Bowery, Fain was particularly rigorous in assessing ideas with a long-range lens. “SaaS on the farm is a great business. Precision agriculture is another great industry. But they didn’t capture my passion, my imagination and my enthusiasm. That component of the stew is incredibly important when you’re founding any business, because of how long and hard of a journey building a company really is,” says Fain.\n\nHe wasn’t the only one who had felt the sting of founder burnout. “I’ve seen friends get incredibly excited about an idea. They go out and they raise some money and then very quickly the excitement sort of evaporates. And now you’re stuck building this company that you’re only moderately interested in. As I was looking at and evaluating different ideas, even when I got more and more excited, I paced myself. It was critical to keep turning over other rocks,” says Fain. “The core question you should be getting to is, ‘Am I going to be excited about this in three years, in five years in seven years?”\n\nI wanted to make sure that the excitement for the idea grew and grew over time. That in the great times, and in the difficult times, my passion, enthusiasm and real love of the problem and the business would persist.\n\nCover image by Getty Images / seb_ra.",

I can’t think of a better voice to pose this question since he catapulted us into the Internet age two and a half decades ago when he built the first web browser and server.But we also need tools for how to do this.I would like to share the best method I have found: Backcasting.The future doesn’t happen to us; it happens because of usThe future is not like the weather. It doesn’t just happen. People make the future. It’s not a destiny or hope; it’s a decision.Steve Jobs didn’t “discover” a market need for smartphones or tablets: He designed the category and taught us how to think about it.Elon Musk did the same with electric cars and commercial space travel.So, how do legendary people make the future? How can you be a legendary builder of a breakthrough idea? That’s where Backcasting comes in.Get out of the present“The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.” — William GibsonBefore getting to details of how Backcasting works, it helps to get in the right frame of mind.Breakthrough builders are visitors from the future, telling us what’s coming.They seem crazy in the present but they are right about the future.Legendary builders, therefore, must stand in the future and pull the present from the current reality to the future of their design. People living in the present usually dislike breakthrough ideas when they first hear about them. They have no context for what will be radically different in the future. So an important additional job of the builder is to persuade early like-minded people to join a new movement.That means that most of your friends, advisors, and even investors are useless at helping you identify a breakthrough.Getting out of the present and standing in the future is the first key to finding a breakthrough.It’s how you get in the right mindset to arrive at breakthrough insights.But once you are in the right frame of mind, how do you get out of the present? Enter Backcasting.Backcast, don’t forecastSince most people live in the present, they try to predict the future by forecasting, which projects forward from what is already known.Forecasting works best when you are on a trajectory and you want to stay on it. But when it comes to building breakthroughs, forecasting falls short. As Albert Einstein famously warned,“The significant problems cannot be solved by the same thinking that created them.”Forecasters typically consider incremental changes to existing products and markets. Forecasting also takes present problems into the future with us. Perhaps most importantly, forecasting assumes the world is mostly the same in the future and that we should operate within the rules rather than think of ways to change the rules.Backcasting is the opposite of forecasting.It works best when you want to create something extraordinarily unique and surprising. Something that’s not incrementally better, but exponentially different and unique.As you backcast, you are likely to find that many current assumptions about products and markets won’t be true in the future. Your goal is to find insights about the future that are non-consensus and right.Starting from the future and working backwards is the second key to finding a breakthrough.It’s how you avoid the temptation to fall prey to incremental ideas and playing by other people’s rules.So how do you Backcast? There are three key steps:Step 1: Look for InflectionsExponential inflections power massive breakthroughs. They resemble waves with a giant gathering force. In my experience working with amazing start-ups, I have seen several types of inflections:Technology inflections involve exponential improvements in the price/performance of technologies like computation, sensor accuracy, bandwidth, and the like.When Floodgate invested in Lyft (Zimride at the time), one of the inflections was that GPS locators in smartphones were becoming orders of magnitude more accurate, which meant they would be able to locate riders and drivers much more precisely.Adoption inflections involve nonlinear changes in the adoption rate of a technology.Returning to the Lyft example, in 2010 we believed it was likely smartphone adoption would increase exponentially. This meant we could imagine enough drivers and riders would have smartphones to make it possible to build a scalable transportation network in the future.Regulatory inflections involve changes in regulations that open up massive new opportunities.An example I have been tracking is the easing of restrictions in telemedicine, which now makes it legal for doctors to serve patients across State boundaries.Returning to the telemedicine example, the necessity of health care for COVID-19 patients is likely to increase the number of patients and doctors who are comfortable with telemedicine by an order of magnitude. It becomes a belief inflection if these changes become more than temporary.Inflections should be understood even before markets. Entrepreneurs who live in the present tend to make the mistake of starting with the market first. They analyze current markets for unsolved pain or for segments that are currently unserved or for “whitespace” in markets. But you are more likely to discover a breakthrough market opportunity by starting with inflections, the chaos they cause, and then working backwards. You arrive at the breakthrough market opportunity by following the inflections.For instance, if you are looking for breakthroughs in elder care, rather than studying the elder care market and looking for pain points and market openings, consider first asking which technology, adoption, regulatory, and belief inflections create the conditions for an exponential breakthrough.Finding inflections is how a builder finds opportunities that can have an exponential impact.This is why it’s the best place to start.Step 2: Backcast from Potential FuturesIn contrast to “Projected” futures, which are a byproduct of forecasting, Backcasting considers more exponential and surprising futures, which I refer to as “Plausible,” “Possible,” and “Preposterous.”Backcasting considers a far broader set of potential futures that are not projected from a forecast.Plausible futures are those that you would not anticipate, but make sense once you hear them.One of my favorite examples of this is with Okta, a company we invested in back in 2010.Todd McKinnon had been VP of Engineering at Salesforce.Freddy Kerrest and Todd McKinnon from Okta: Time travelers from a “Plausible” future.He knew the early adopters of cloud computing. He imagined lots of technology would run in the cloud and customers would struggle to make it all work together. Once you heard Todd explain the future need for unified identity across cloud products, it seemed totally plausible that his intuition was right and he was in the best position to build what was missing in that future.Possible futures often start as a hobby or obsession that turns into an unexpected breakthrough.A great example is Marc Andreessen himself. He was living in the future because he was working at a supercomputer lab with a superfast network at the University of Illinois.Marc Andreessen in the early 90s: Time traveler from a “Possible” future.He wanted to enable collaboration between researchers and built the Mosaic browser and web server to solve his own problem. Marc was living in the future and building things that would make the future he wanted immediately more useful to him.However, most people didn’t think his work was important at the time. From the vantage point of the present, it seemed that big companies like AT&T and Time Warner would build the “digital superhighway” from the top down.Netscape happened because Marc followed his obsession until the next logical step was to build a company. Lots of great breakthroughs come from builders like this, such as the original Apple computer, Microsoft Basic, 3Com for the Ethernet, etc.Preposterous futures seem crazy to almost everybody. The poster child for building these futures is Elon Musk.Elon Musk: Turning the seemingly “Preposterous” into realityWho else decides to build an electric car company when a successful American car company had not been built in half a century?Who decides they can be the first non-government entity to blast rockets into outer space?But it turns out that Elon is the right kind of crazy. All of his ideas have come together because of a combination of inflections in battery technology, sensors, big data AI, computing power, etc. When Elon talks about reasoning from first principles, he is naturally harnessing the power of multiple inflections on the horizon and pulling them together into something seemingly impossible.Backcasting from potential futures widens the range of possible futures you can consider.It opens your mind to ideas that are more exponential and surprising, which increases your chance to find breakthrough Insights, which is what comes next.Step 3: Gather breakthrough insightsArmed with your inflections and a range of potential futures, the next step is to gather Insights.People build things all the time; Those who build breakthroughs realize not all opportunities are equal. A poor insight will usually result in a mundane opportunity, even with great execution. A brilliant insight creates far more answers to the question “What could go right?”, giving the builder many more ways to change the future if the team executes well.Finding breakthrough insights requires asking the right questions to the right people.“Seers” are people who you believe are living in the future around a given inflection. They might be entrepreneurs, researchers, academics, futurists, hobbyists, Angel investors, and the like. These are the people you want to spend time with.Insights are different than analysis. They uncover ideas that are exponential and surprising rather than facts that can be analyzed. This is why it’s crucial to ask the right types of questions and to make sure you are not talking to people who are overly tethered to the present. Examples of the types of questions might be:What assumptions about the future might be wrong?What could happen with this inflection that is more likely than most believe?What is less likely to happen than many believe?What is a preposterous potential future that might not be so crazy after all?What would be the best outcomes from this inflection that could realistically happen?What would be the worst outcome?From the diagram below, you observe that insights can exist at different points in the future (horizontal axis) and can involve different levels of “surprise” (vertical axis). Insights flow from applying the power of inflections to different potential scenarios at different times in the future.Insights (represented by lightbulbs in the graph) are future scenarios that are exponential and surprising.It’s best to collect multiple insights and compare and contrast them. Brainstorm, discuss and argue about the future you’re exploring. Think about futures that you are uniquely capable of creating. Which scenarios align with your passion, risk tolerance, and capabilities?Then ask, “What type of team would I need to make each insight real? “How likely am I to create the best team to pursue each insight?Bet on YOUUltimately, an Insight is like a “bet.”You are betting on your insight and you are betting on yourself to be the creator of a future you want. An insight about the future that is non-consensus and right, powered by inflections, and driven by someone “crazy enough” to make it happen….this is the Archimedes lever for building a breakthrough product that moves the world.“Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”-Steve JobsJust like the greats of the past, you too can build greatness.Now, more than ever, the world needs more entrepreneurs, who have the courage to step up, in the face of great odds and design an exponentially different future.The present has stopped working. We must create a different future.If you like the concept of Backcasting and you are energized to build something great, I would like to hear your story.

We can live in a world that we design.” — from the Greatest ShowmanMarc Andreessen’s call to arms — It’s Time to Build is a powerful manifesto for a more ambitious future. If you haven’t read it already, you should.Marc closes his post by asking what ideas people have for building breakthroughs. I can’t think of a better voice to pose this question since he catapulted us into the Internet age two and a half decades ago when he built the first web browser and server.But we also need tools for how to do this.I would like to share the best method I have found: Backcasting.The future doesn’t happen to us; it happens because of usThe future is not like the weather. It doesn’t just happen. People make the future. It’s not a destiny or hope; it’s a decision.Steve Jobs didn’t “discover” a market need for smartphones or tablets: He designed the category and taught us how to think about it.Elon Musk did the same with electric cars and commercial space travel.So, how do legendary people make the future? How can you be a legendary builder of a breakthrough idea? That’s where Backcasting comes in.Get out of the present“The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.” — William GibsonBefore getting to details of how Backcasting works, it helps to get in the right frame of mind.Breakthrough builders are visitors from the future, telling us what’s coming.They seem crazy in the present but they are right about the future.Legendary builders, therefore, must stand in the future and pull the present from the current reality to the future of their design. People living in the present usually dislike breakthrough ideas when they first hear about them. They have no context for what will be radically different in the future. So an important additional job of the builder is to persuade early like-minded people to join a new movement.That means that most of your friends, advisors, and even investors are useless at helping you identify a breakthrough.Getting out of the present and standing in the future is the first key to finding a breakthrough.It’s how you get in the right mindset to arrive at breakthrough insights.But once you are in the right frame of mind, how do you get out of the present? Enter Backcasting.Backcast, don’t forecastSince most people live in the present, they try to predict the future by forecasting, which projects forward from what is already known.Forecasting works best when you are on a trajectory and you want to stay on it. But when it comes to building breakthroughs, forecasting falls short. As Albert Einstein famously warned,“The significant problems cannot be solved by the same thinking that created them.”Forecasters typically consider incremental changes to existing products and markets. Forecasting also takes present problems into the future with us. Perhaps most importantly, forecasting assumes the world is mostly the same in the future and that we should operate within the rules rather than think of ways to change the rules.Backcasting is the opposite of forecasting.It works best when you want to create something extraordinarily unique and surprising. Something that’s not incrementally better, but exponentially different and unique.As you backcast, you are likely to find that many current assumptions about products and markets won’t be true in the future. Your goal is to find insights about the future that are non-consensus and right.Starting from the future and working backwards is the second key to finding a breakthrough.It’s how you avoid the temptation to fall prey to incremental ideas and playing by other people’s rules.So how do you Backcast? There are three key steps:Step 1: Look for InflectionsExponential inflections power massive breakthroughs. They resemble waves with a giant gathering force. In my experience working with amazing start-ups, I have seen several types of inflections:Technology inflections involve exponential improvements in the price/performance of technologies like computation, sensor accuracy, bandwidth, and the like.When Floodgate invested in Lyft (Zimride at the time), one of the inflections was that GPS locators in smartphones were becoming orders of magnitude more accurate, which meant they would be able to locate riders and drivers much more precisely.Adoption inflections involve nonlinear changes in the adoption rate of a technology.Returning to the Lyft example, in 2010 we believed it was likely smartphone adoption would increase exponentially. This meant we could imagine enough drivers and riders would have smartphones to make it possible to build a scalable transportation network in the future.Regulatory inflections involve changes in regulations that open up massive new opportunities.An example I have been tracking is the easing of restrictions in telemedicine, which now makes it legal for doctors to serve patients across State boundaries.Returning to the telemedicine example, the necessity of health care for COVID-19 patients is likely to increase the number of patients and doctors who are comfortable with telemedicine by an order of magnitude. It becomes a belief inflection if these changes become more than temporary.Inflections should be understood even before markets. Entrepreneurs who live in the present tend to make the mistake of starting with the market first. They analyze current markets for unsolved pain or for segments that are currently unserved or for “whitespace” in markets. But you are more likely to discover a breakthrough market opportunity by starting with inflections, the chaos they cause, and then working backwards. You arrive at the breakthrough market opportunity by following the inflections.For instance, if you are looking for breakthroughs in elder care, rather than studying the elder care market and looking for pain points and market openings, consider first asking which technology, adoption, regulatory, and belief inflections create the conditions for an exponential breakthrough.Finding inflections is how a builder finds opportunities that can have an exponential impact.This is why it’s the best place to start.Step 2: Backcast from Potential FuturesIn contrast to “Projected” futures, which are a byproduct of forecasting, Backcasting considers more exponential and surprising futures, which I refer to as “Plausible,” “Possible,” and “Preposterous.”\n\nMarc Andreessen’s call to arms — It’s Time to Build is a powerful manifesto for a more ambitious future.

He imagined lots of technology would run in the cloud and customers would struggle to make it all work together. Once you heard Todd explain the future need for unified identity across cloud products, it seemed totally plausible that his intuition was right and he was in the best position to build what was missing in that future.Possible futures often start as a hobby or obsession that turns into an unexpected breakthrough.A great example is Marc Andreessen himself. He was living in the future because he was working at a supercomputer lab with a superfast network at the University of Illinois.Marc Andreessen in the early 90s: Time traveler from a “Possible” future.He wanted to enable collaboration between researchers and built the Mosaic browser and web server to solve his own problem.

    "ai_summary": "Summary:\nThe article, \"How to build a breakthrough\" by Mike Maples, Jr., discusses the concept of Backcasting as a tool for creating innovative ideas and products. Maples asserts that the future is not a given, but something that is shaped by individuals and their decisions. He argues that to build breakthroughs, one must adopt a future-oriented mindset, identify inflections, and gather insights by asking the right questions to the right people.\n\nKey Insights:\n- The future is not a predetermined event but is shaped by individuals and their decisions. Innovators like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk didn't discover market needs; they created them.\n- Backcasting, as opposed to forecasting, is a more effective method for innovation. It involves starting from a future point and working backwards, identifying the steps needed to reach that future.\n- Identifying inflections, such as technological advancements or regulatory changes, is crucial for finding opportunities with exponential impact.\n- Gathering insights requires asking the right questions to the right people. These insights should be exponential and surprising, not just facts that can be analyzed.\n- An insight is like a bet. It's a wager on a non-consensus future that is right, powered by inflections, and driven by someone willing to make it happen.\n\nMain Takeaways:\n- To build a breakthrough, adopt a future-oriented mindset and use Backcasting to identify",

The four essential filters are: A business with a moat, A business that can be understood by the investor, Management in place with integrity and talent, and A business that can be bought at an attractive price that gives an attractive margin of safety. http://www.psyfitec.com/2009/10/buffett-and-munger-on-bbc.html Before examining each of these four essential filters one-by one, it is important to point out that these “four skills” below which relate to moats are very different that the four essential filters themselves: Creating a moat which is something that people like Ray Kroc, Sam Walton Estee Lauder, Mary Kay Ash and Bill Gates have accomplished. Moat creation requires superior management skill always combined with some degree of luck. It is theoretically possible to acquire a moat with no management talent and just luck but I can’t think of an example of this ever happening. Sometimes people who are fantastic managers who have the ability to create a moat have very poor skills when it comes to investing. Stock promoters love these people since they are big targets for scams. Identifying a moat that others have created which is something that people like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett can do. Munger admits that he and Warren Buffett buy moats rather than build them since building them is not something they do particularly well. In addition to a moat Charlie insists that there be a talented management team already in place. For an investor who buys moats instead of creating one, the existence of a moat has special value since they can sometimes survive financially even if management talent does not deliver as expected or if they leave the business. Identifying a startup that may acquire a moat before it is evident which is something that some venture capitalists can do at a sufficiently high level of probability that they can generate an attractive return on capital overall. This skill is very rare as evidenced by the fact that the distribution of returns in venture capital is a power law. Moats that emerge from complex adaptive systems like an economy are hard to spot since a moat is something that greater than the sum of the parts emerging from something else that is greater than the sum of its parts. In contrast, a moat being destroyed is easier to spot since it is a process of something transforming into nothing. Describing a moat in academic terms which is something that someone like Michael Porter can do. Why this is a rare talent in academia is a puzzle. The reason for this is that simple theories are not the sort of things that will get a person a tenured faculty position. This essay could go on for many pages quoting Munger railing about deficiencies in academia. Here are just two: “I was recently speaking with Jack McDonald, who teaches a course on investing rooted in our principles at Stanford Business School. He said it’s lonely — like he’s the Maytag repairman.” http://www.fool.com/boringport/2000/boringport00051500.htm “ Warren once said to me, “I’m probably misjudging academia generally [in thinking so poorly of it] because the people who interact with me have bonkers theories.” … We’re trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low - or even a fair price. The reason the professors teach such nonsense is that if they didn’t], what would they teach the rest of the semester?” http://www.tilsonfunds.com/motley_berkshire_wescomeetings.php (2004) Each of these four skills which relate to moats is very different and it is unusual for a person to have all four skills. Many people just have one. More importantly, well over 90% of the population of the world has none of these skills. Tragically for them, the population that thinks they have this set of skills is far higher than 10%. For society, this overconfidence is valuable since “even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while” via luck. Merely because a person can identify that a given company has a moat does not mean that they have any ability to create a moat as a manager. At the 2012 Berkshire meeting Munger admitted that the brand-based moats which Berkshire has are bought rather than created. The ability to spot a moat that someone else created is very different from the ability to create a moat, believes Munger. You don’t need to know how to make hamburgers to spot that McDonald’s’ has a moat, but don’t try to build a business like McDonald’s without the abilities that Ray Kroc had. At the 2012 Berkshire meeting Charlie said: “We buy barriers. Building them is tough… Our great brands aren’t anything we’ve created. We’ve bought them. If you’re buying something at a huge discount to its replacement value and it is hard to replace, you have a big advantage. One competitor is enough to ruin a business running on small margins.” http://gongol.com/research/berkshire/2012/ Sometimes great managers can transition to become great venture capitalists and sometimes not. As another example, Michael Porter has done a great job taking some fundamental ideas from microeconomics and introducing it to business schools, but I would not give him five cents to start a business or invest money on my behalf. Perhaps he is a good manager or investor but I have zero data to indicate that this might be true other than he has described some important principles in an academic way. Recently someone argued on a blog that because some academics affiliated with Michael Porter’s theory on sustainable competitive advantage do not have the management skill required to create a moat themselves, that “sustainable competitive advantage simply doesn’t exist” other than created by government regulation. http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/11/20/what-killed-michael-porters-monitor-group-the-one-force-that-really-matters/ First and most importantly, as will be explained below, the test of whether a moat exist is quantitative (it is a 100% math-based test). The simple of mathematics reveals that many companies have moats in many sectors of the economy that have existed for many years. Second, as I have explained above, not everyone has all four skills that relate to moats. That a team of academics can’t create a moat does not mean sustainable competitive advantage does not exist. The act of successfully creating a moat is a rare event. Berkshire’s portfolio of companies alone (e.g., See’s Candies) proves that moats are sustainable for a very long time. Google and Oracle are just two of many companies that have generated sustained profitability that meets the test for a moat. The blogger’s own thesis is that companies should continuously innovate instead. That Porter’s work would not support the need to constantly innovate, create new value or disrupt your own business is a baffling conclusion. The two issues are orthogonal. The thesis that Clayton Christensen’s work invalidates the work of his fellow professor at Harvard Business School Michael Porter is simply false. That profit is hard to sustain does not mean that it is impossible to sustain. Nowhere does Michael Porter say that a moat can be maintained forever. The blogger’s thesis also suffers in that it has no predictive power. It is consistent with the sort of promotion that you see around hyped IPOs. “It’s disruptive!” is not a substitute for profit unless your goal is to flip the business to someone else. Disruption alone without anything behind it is the management equivalent of EBITDA. Clayton Christensen’s work around disruptive innovation is super important and wise (you will see links to it below), but don’t kid yourself that disruption without a moat will necessarily lead to actual GAAP profit. Disruption is a fantastic place to look for profit whether the business is a startup or an established business, but sometimes profit is just not there. If you don’t have a moat somewhere and are unable to flip your company to a greater fool or a company that is already profitable who needs it for defensive reasons, you will soon fall prey to the only unforgivable sin in business: running out of cash. Giving away everything for free while generating zero profit is at best an interim strategy or a description of the Java business model that Sun adopted. Do some companies create something so disruptive that benefits consumers so much that someone must buy that service or product to stay competitive even though it generates no incremental profit? Absolutely. But in such a case only consumers benefit since only positive outcome is the creation of consumer surplus. Producer surplus for that disruptive innovation can be zero or less than zero. That is part of the reason why capitalism benefits consumers. To offer a “loss leader” you must in the medium term at least have a base business that generates a profit that is tied to that loss. But I am getting ahead of myself. You can read more on disruption in a futurepost. Returning to the discussion of the four essential filters, whether a business has a durable moat is without question the most important filter for an investor like Charlie whose chosen profession is buying moats. For example, Charlie describes a moat in three different ways immediately below, each emphasizing the importance of the moat being able to maintain itself over time. “We have to have a business with some inherent characteristics that give it a durable competitive advantage.” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XlBrohrIUc “The number one idea is to view a stock as an ownership of the business and to judge the staying quality of the business in terms of its competitive advantage.” http://www.valuewalk.com/charlie-munger-page/ “We’re trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low - or even a fair price.” Charlie may reference another of the four essential filters in a statement but invariably the requirement of a moat is present in his statement. My belief is that of the four filters, nothing is more essential than moat. The second filter is about reducing the number of mistakes made and filters three and four essentially layer on a “margin of safety” when making an investment. In other words, moats are the foundation of Munger’s investment process and methodology. Everything starts with the moat (or lack of a moat) for Charlie because he does not create moats, he buys them. Components of a Moat: Munger has not explained his theories on what causes a moat as comprehensively as Warren Buffett, but he has made some comments that point people in the right direction. In addition there are all the companies in the Berkshire portfolio that illustrate what a moat is, like Geico, Burlington Northern, See’s Candies. The primary components of a moat that Charlie has talked about are as follows: 1. Supply-Side Economies of Scale There are two types of “economies of scale” and the first is supply-side economies of scale. A large firm that is part of an oligopolistic market will generate significant supply-side economies of scale in its production of goods and services as per-unit costs fall with increasing output. Due to factors like the difficulty of managing large firms, economies of scale ar exhausted well before those firms from dominate the entire market.” The economists Varian and Shapiro in their book Information Rules write about supply-side economies of scale via an example: “Despite its supply-side economies of scale, General Motors never grew to take over the entire automobile market.” Samsung is reaping the benefits of supply-side economies of scale as does Intel. Clayton Christensen argues that the worship false accounting gods like RONA have caused many companies to outsource tasks like the semiconductor fabrication and lose important supply- side economies. He argues that outsourcing has harmed many companies in the long-term even though in the short-term it may have seemed wise. http://gartner.mediasite.com/mediasite/play/9cfe6bba5c7941e09bee95eb63f769421d In Charlie’s view Wal-Mart has massive supply-side economies of scale through its investments in distribution and other systems. These and other Wal-Mart investments have given the company a moat. Wal-Mart also possesses a high degree of operational effectiveness which adds it its profitability. Like Wal-Mart companies which operate huge steel plants and shipyards can have supply-side economies of scale. Markets like these tend to end up as part of an oligopoly since supply-side advantages only go so far to consolidate an industry. Munger described two different supply-side economies of scale below: “On the subject of economies of scale, I find chain stores quite interesting. Just think about it. The concept of a chain store was a fascinating invention. You get this huge purchasing power — which means that you have lower merchandise costs. You get a whole bunch of little laboratories out there in which you can conduct experiments. And you get specialization. If one little guy is trying to buy across 27 different merchandise categories influenced by traveling salesmen, he’s going to make a lot of dumb decisions. But if you’re buying is done in headquarters for a huge bunch of stores, you can get very bright people who know a lot about refrigerators and so forth to do the buying. The reverse is demonstrated by the little store where one guy is doing all the buying. So there are huge purchasing advantages. Some [supply-side advantages] come from simple geometry. If you’re building a great circular tank, obviously as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface goes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of steel. There are all kinds of things like that where the simple geometry - the simple reality - gives you an advantage of scale.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html Munger explains below how changes that have taken place in the advertising industry, which perhaps explain why Procter & Gamble has started to struggle more than it has in the past in delivering the same level of profitability: “You can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. When TV advertising first arrived - when talking color pictures first came into our living rooms - it was an unbelievably powerful thing. And in the early days, we had three networks that had whatever it was - say 90% of the audience. Well, if you were Procter & Gamble, you could afford to use this new method of advertising. You could afford the very expensive cost of network television because you were selling so damn many cans and bottles. Some little guy couldn’t. And there was no way of buying it in part. Therefore, he couldn’t use it. In effect, if you didn’t have a big volume, you couldn’t use network TV advertising - which was the most effective technique. So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge tail wind.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html This may also explain in part why Berkshire has dropped its stake in Johnson and Johnson to very low levels. Johnson and Johnson has been a lagging performer for Berkshire and is now out of favor with Munger and Buffett. Although Berkshire was a bit late to appreciate the attractiveness to an investor of the railroad business, Munger and Buffett clearly value the moat that supply-side economies scale creates in the railroad business. A new competitor in the railroad business is highly unlikely. As the public roads deteriorate as the United States underinvests in infrastructure and energy prices rise, railroads will get even more competitive. Munger has said: “Do you know what it would cost to replace Burlington Northern today? We are not going to build another transcontinental. And those assets are valuable, have utility. Now they want to raise diesel prices on trucks. … We finally realized that railroads now have a huge competitive advantage, with double stacked rail cars, guided by computers, moving more and more production from China, etc. They have a big advantage over truckers in huge classes of business. http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf Railroads are interesting in that long ago they were a growth industry that both created great fortunes and great busts in the aftermath of that success. There were times in history when railroads were very lousy investments. Regarding the impact of supply-side economies of scale Charlie has pointed out: “In some businesses, the very nature of things cascades toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm. It tends to cascade to a winner take all result. And these advantages of scale are so great, for example, that when Jack Welch came into General Electric, he just said, ‘to hell with it. We’re either going to be number one or two in every field we’re in or we’re going to be out’. That was a very tough-minded thing to do, but I think it was a correct decision if you’re thinking about maximizing shareholder wealth.” Berkshire has recently sold nearly all of its shares in GE, which is a reminder that moats come and go as time passes and conditions change. People who follow Munger and Buffett might have laughed not too long ago if someone were to have predicted that GE would lose favor with Berkshire. 2. Demand-side Economies of Scale (Network Effects): Demand-side economies of scale (also known as “network effects”) result when a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it. Unlike supply-side economies of scale, network effects can be (1) nonlinear and (2) continue to accrue to benefit the company for far longer. Given a choice between supply-side economies of scale and demand-side economies of scale, it is preferable to have the latter. Varian and Shapiro in their book Information Rules write: “Unlike the supply-side economies of scale, demand-side economies of scale don’t dissipate when the market gets large enough.” eBay, Craigslist, Twitter, Facebook and other multi-sided markets have demand-side economies of scale that operate on their behalf. My view is that ESPN also has demand-side economies of scale, most notable for Sports Center, since the more people who watch the ESPN channels, the more valuable the channels are to each user since those particular images will be the basis of discussion for sports fanatics. Fox and other sports channels just can’t replicate that demand side effects since when someone says “did you see X do Y in the Z game?” If you watched Fox version of Sports Center, you may not have seen the particular video clip. Google has at least two beneficial demand-side economies of scale (one for search and one for advertising targeting) that are mutually reinforcing that give it a strong moat according. Munger has said: “Google has a huge new moat. In fact I’ve probably never seen such a wide moat.” http://seekingalpha.com/article/140485-would-buffett-consider-google-a-great-investment “I don’t know how you displace Google but a lot of the other companies will have competitive troubles.” http://www.investingdaily.com/11313/google-up-13-on-great-earnings-and-google-is-facebook-in-trouble Some companies have both demand and supply-side economies of scale. Amazon has both supply-side and demand-side economies of scale and they reinforce each other. For example, the more people who provide comments on Amazon the more valuable it becomes to other users due to demand-side economies. Amazon also has huge advantages on warehouses and the supply chain on the supply-side. There are both weak and strong supply-side demand-side economies of scale and they fall along a continuum in terms of relative strength. Most companies have both supply-side and demand-side economies. The “holy grail” for an entrepreneur is demand-side economies of scale that can cause a market to “tip” and give almost the entire market to one company. The reality is that most demand-side economies do not cause a market to “tip.” For example, GM’s cars were better to a degree at one point since the more people who owned the cars, the easier auto parts were to get, but weak demand-side economies like that were not strong enough to make the market “tip.” If a market does “tip” and a competitor is the one to reap those benefits, things can go really wrong, really fast. For example, MySpace started to monetize before the social networking market “tipped” and MySpace paid the price and Facebook reaped the rewards. Facebook held off monetizing until its moat was secure. Zuckerberg was patient about waiting for the market to tip and Rupert Murdoch was not. One illustrative example can be found in the cement industry. Cemex’s cement business gets better the more trucks it has in play in a given geographic area. The service gets cheaper with supply-side scale due to lower COGS (e.g., less gas consumed), it gets better (faster delivery times) due to demand-side economies. And that combination of supply and demand-side economies creates a barrier to entry that helps Cemex. Which came first, the faster supply of cement to contractors due to more plants (the egg) or greater demand from contractors due to faster delivery times (the chicken)? I believe Cemex intentionally created an egg, knowing there would be greater demand for the service. This solution to the “chicken and egg” problem is typical in multi-sided markets. However, in this case the Cemex demand-side economies were not strong enough to make their market for cement tip. My thesis about Chinese restaurants is similar: When you have more customers for Chinese food, the food turns over faster and so it is fresher and better, holding the level of cooking constant. More customers for Chinese food not only lowers cost of goods sold (COGS) since they buy in volume, but increases quality. But a market like this is not going to tip As another example, Costco is a better value the more its “store geographic scope” and density increases since I can, for example, use it when visiting relative in another state. Costco also has supply-side economies of scale. Since a market like Costco is in is not going to tip and so oligopoly is likely. It could be argued that Cemex, GM and Chinese restaurants with high volumes have some demand-side economies of scale in addition to their supply-side economies of scale. But the demand-side economies are not strong enough to tip to one dominant supplier. Lots of other industries are similar. Credit card markets did not tip enough to prevent multiple providers. Car rentals did not tip and are instead an oligopoly. Supply-side economies of scale can be really powerful. The jet turbine makers have supply-side advantages that makes them very profitable. Are there advantages to customers of easier access to parts if they buy a Rolls Royce jet turbine that might create some demand-side benefits? Sure. But can China open its checkbook and create a new jet engine competitor? I think so. In the case of jet turbines supply-side benefits are strong, but demand-side benefits are weak. American Express is another company in the Berkshire portfolio with demand-side economies of scale since the more merchants accept their card the more valuable the service gets and the more people who use the card the more valuable the services is for merchants. Munger continues to believe American Express has a moat despite the rise of upstarts like Square. “It would be easier to screw up American Express than Coke or Gillette, but it’s an immensely strong business.” http://www.fool.com/boringport/2000/boringport000501a.htm Visa has a similar moat to American Express as does PayPal. But challengers like Square may change the game enough to take significant share. eBay’s moat is definitely demand-side driven on its original business as well. A company having beneficial network effects is only one dimension that impacts profit. Sometimes network effects are there but the market is small since it is a niche. Amazon’s market is bigger and that matters greatly in terms of the market capitalization it can generate. Some network effects are very strong like Google’s and sometimes they are weaker like for web sites that crowd source reviews which contain a lot of noise that is hard to automate out. 3. Brand At the 2011 meeting of Wesco held just before it was merged into Berkshire Hathaway, Munger admitted that he and Buffett really did not understand the value of a brand until they bought See’s Candies. The two investors found after they bought See’s Candies they could regularly raise prices and customers did not seem to care. Buffett and Munger call this ability “pricing power.” Munger notes that before See’s Candies: “We didn’t know the power of a good brand. Over time we just discovered that we could raise prices 10% a year and no one cared. Learning this changed Berkshire. It was really important.” http://theinvestmentsblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/final-wesco-meeting-morning-with.htm See’s Candies is also a great A/B test on brand power. To illustrate, if you grew up in a home that bought See’s Candies (mostly on the West Coast, especially in California) and experiences around that candy have very favorable associations, you will pay more for that boxed candy brand. Someone who grew up in the east cost of the United States is going to shop for boxed candy and not attribute much value to the brand since they do not have those same experiences. For this reason, See’s has found it hard to expand regionally and has done so very slowly.. See’s Candies can also only sell so much candy at that price given the choices it has made. People don’t usually go to a See’s Candies store because they are hungry for food. The box/gift candy business is very seasonal. What See’s sells is not just food, but rather an experience. See’s generates losses two quarters a year and makes all its profit in the other two quarters around three holidays. Buffett talks about the fact that building some brands took many decades: “When you were a 16-year-old, you took a box of candy on your first date with a girl and gave it either to her parents or to her. I California the girls slap you when you bring Russell Stover, and kiss you when you bring See’s.”… “I don’t think See’s means anything to people on the East Coast, where people are also exposed to higher-end chocolate products.” http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/22/sees-candies-buffett-berkshire/ While some of the power of a brand can come from taste, modern “flavor” firms can replicate most any taste. Trade dress and presentation of a good or service matters more than ever. A lot of Tiffany’s brand power is the blue box the jewelry comes in. Coke made a massive mistake thinking it was flavor in a blind taste test that mattered when it introduced the New Coke. When the taste test is not blind Coke wins and when it is blind Coke does not win. Munger said once about the New Coke episode: “[Coke spent] 100 years getting people to believe that trademark had all these intangible values too. And people associate it with a flavor…. Pepsi was within weeks of coming out with old Coke in a Pepsi bottle, which would’ve been the biggest fiasco in modern times. Perfect insanity.” http://www.rbcpa.com/Mungerspeech_june_95.pdf Although it is not currently doing as well financially as it has in the past, Charlie has admired Procter & Gamble since: “They just make a fortune on some of the body products. Some of these brands, I mean, if you can make something that actually improves the skin, wow. That’s the last thing people will give up”. http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/22/buffett-munger-berkshire As was noted above, it can be argued that TV does not give Procter & Gamble the same benefits supply-side economies in television since post Internet there are so many ways to advertise that do not require supply-side scale. The argument would be that smaller firms and store brands are making big inroads by using new forms of marketing and Procter & Gamble suffers from that new competition as their brand is weakened. As another example, Charlie said once that customer loyalty to Costco is a big part of their moat: “If you get hooked on going to Costco with your family, you’ll go there for the rest of your life.” http://bitly.com/YsZny5 I am skeptical that “getting hooked” is a brand advantage and instead suspect that Costco’s moat is more about great business execution by Costco plus supply-side economies of scale. The Costco brand is valuable, but not enough by itself to fully explain its profitability. Most moats are caused by multiple factors. Clayton Christensen makes a very powerful argument that companies like Costco, Zara and Ikea create a moat by integrating around “a job” that a customer need to get done. You can hear Clayton make that argument here in this video: http://gartner.mediasite.com/mediasite/play/9cfe6bba5c7941e09bee95eb63f769421d It sounds similar to arguments that Michael Porter makes about the value of integration of all the aspects of what a company does, but around a task. Perhaps Berkshire believes that this is a source of a moat for Well Fargo. A moat powered by a brand is something very different from one created via supply-side economies of scale. For example, Warren Buffett has said that for a company like Disney when the brand is mentioned in conversation “you have something in your mind.” He adds: “How would you try to create a brand that competes with Disney? Coke is a brand associated with people being happy around the world. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the moat. You want that moat to widen.” http://investdigest.blogspot.com/2005/12/untapped-pricing-power-and-share-of.html One company that is puzzling is the eyeglass maker Luxottica’s (brands like Ray-Ban, Oakley, Persol and other major brands). How that eyeglass company can have that much market share since it has so many brands is unusual. There must be supply-side economies that are driving that business. I just don’t see any real significant demand-side economies that might explain Luxottica’s level of success. Could is be that they reap a lot of benefits from organization around a job a customer need to get done. Perhaps, but that seems to be a stretch. Brands of course can fail over time. Put a luxury brand on a table or shelf in Costco as some have done and that luxury brand is damaged. License it too broadly and the brand is also damaged. Buffett and Munger see attracted to brand that they use in their own lives. See’s and Dairy Queen are just two examples. Some brands incur problems with their brand that are completely self-inflected. Buffett went on to say about one his most favorite brands: “Take See’s candy. You cannot destroy the brand of See’s candy. Only See’s can do that. You have to look at the brand as a promise to the customer that we are going to offer the quality and service that is expected. We link the product with happiness. You don’t see See’s candy sponsoring the local funeral home. We are at the Thanksgiving Day Parades though.” http://www.buffettfaq.com/ Regarding brand power, the two Berkshire leaders have often cited Wrigley’s as a brand that creates strong moat. Munger has pointed out: “The informational advantage of brands is hard to beat. And your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley chewing gum alongside Glotz’s chewing gum. Well, I know that Wrigley is a satisfactory product, whereas I don’t know anything about Glotz’s. So if one is $.40 and the other is $.30, am I going to take something I don’t know and put it in my mouth - which is a pretty personal place, after all - for a lousy dime? So, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well-known, has advantages of scale - what you might call an informational advantage. Everyone is influenced by what others do and approve. Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term “social proof”. We are all influenced - subconsciously and to some extent consciously - by what we see others do and approve. Therefore, if everybody’s buying something, we think it’s better. We don’t like to be the one guy who’s out of step. Again, some of this is at a subconscious level and some of it isn’t. Sometimes, we consciously and rationally think, “Gee, I don’t know much about this. They know more than I do. Therefore, why shouldn’t I follow them?” All told, your advantages can add up to one tough moat.” http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf A very important test for Buffett and Munger in determining the strength of a brand- based moat is whether a competitor can replicate or weaken the moat with a massive checkbook. As just one example, here is what Buffett said about Coke at the 2012 Berkshire meeting: “If you gave me $10, $20, $30 billion to knock off Coca-Cola, I couldn’t do it.” Firms like Nike and BMW each have brands that help maintain their moat that were hard to get and super valuable to have. The creation of a great brand is a rare thing and requires considerable skill and arguably a big dose of luck as well. Charlie has pointed out: “China has great companies already. Just not great brand names yet.” I would quibble with Munger’s conclusion in that the Huawei brand is already strong already in certain business markets. And Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei are making brand inroads in mobile phones. China will in my view surely have many strong global brands over the long-term. 4. Regulation: There are certain businesses which have created a competence with regard to regulation that is so high that regulation actually serves as a barrier to entry/moat for their competitors. Rather than helping consumers in these cases on a net basis regulations can end up protecting producers and creating a moat. For example, some people believe banks have created such a powerful layer of regulatory expertise that the regulators have become “captured” by the industry they regulate. There are a number of professional; guilds like lawyers who have been able to use regulation to limit supply. For Berkshire, the regulation-driven moat that Moody’s had in the bond rating business was a big attraction. To issue bonds regulators actually require that the issuer get an opinion from a very small number of bond rating firms which means the rating firms Moody’s, S&P and Fitch have a moat. Fannie and Freddie also had regulatory created moats, but the result for them in the end was not good. When regulation disappears, it often becomes quickly evident that it was a major factor in industry profitability. You find out who is otherwise swimming naked when the regulatory-driven moat disappears. For example, said Munger: “[Airline] Competition was so intense that, once it was unleashed by deregulation, ravaged shareholder wealth in the airline business” http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf Munger once described airlines as “marginal cost with wings.” http://bitly.com/RzDIys People talk about Virgin Airlines having a great brand and better service, but where are the profits? How long will it be before other airlines begin to imitate the Emirates strategy? Where is the barrier to entry for an airline? You can lease jets and gates. Munger and Buffett have said repeatedly over the years that they hate a commodity business. They learned this lesson the hard way by investing in firms like the New England textile manufacturer that gave Berkshire its name. Buffett ignores insurance lines that are commodities as another example Returning to the subject of regulatory capture, Berkshire invests so much money in Well Fargo is interesting since arguably the sorts of banking that Wells Fargo does is a commodity business. It can be argued that Wells Fargo benefits from regulation since it is “too big to fail” and therefore has a lower cost of capital than it would otherwise which gives it a moat. We will discuss Wells Fargo again in a future post when the subject of management is covered. 5. Patents and Intellectual Property Companies which have been granted a patent or other type of intellectual property by a government have in effect been given a legal monopoly. While the justifications for doing so are not the subject of this discussion, this barrier to entry can create a substantial moat for the holder of the intellectual property. Munger has said: “… In microeconomics, of course, you’ve got the concept of patents, trademarks, exclusive franchises and so forth. Patents are quite interesting. When I was young, I think more money went into patents than came out. Judges tended to throw them out - based on arguments about what was really invented and what relied on prior art. That isn’t altogether clear. But they changed that. They didn’t change the laws. They just changed the administration - so that it all goes to one patent court. And that court is now very much more pro-patent. So I think people are now starting to make a lot of money out of owning patents. But trademarks and franchises have always been great. Trademarks, of course, have always made people a lot of money. A trademark system is a wonderful thing for a big operation if it’s well-known.” http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf Qualcomm is an example of a company which has created a moat mostly via intellectual property. Qualcomm has so many patents and has managed to get them embedded inside enough important wireless industry standards which have their own demand-side economies of scales, that the company has created a substantial moat. One example of a company that Berkshire values higher due to intellectual property patents is Lubrizol. Initially Buffett said: “It struck me as a business I didn’t know anything about initially. You know, you’re talking about petroleum additives… Are there competitive moats, is there ease of entry, all that sort of thing. I did not have any understanding of that at all initially. And I talked to Charlie a few days later…and Charlie says, ‘I don’t understand it either.’” http://advisoranalyst.com/glablog/tag/cnbc-interview/ But eventually Buffett was won over and made the Lubrizol purchase. “I decided there’s probably a good size moat on this. They’ve got lots and lots of patents, but more than that they have a connection with customers.” http://advisoranalyst.com/glablog/tag/cnbc-interview/ At the 2011 Berkshire meeting Buffet reiterated that he decided to go ahead since he thought that the more than 1,600 patents held by Lubrizol would give the company “a durable competitive advantage.” Another example of intellectual property proving its value for Munger occurred in the 1970s when Russell Stover Candies started to open stores in markets served by See’s Candies with very similar appearance. The use of the distinctive “trade dress” of See’s Candies was enough of a violation of the law that Munger was able through threat of litigation to get agreement from Russell Stover Candies to stop what they were doing and the moat was proven to be durable. The Nature of Competition and Moats: In Charlie’s view, even if you currently have a good business that does not mean you will have it for very long. This puts the durability of a given moat at risk. The process of what Joseph Schumpeter called “competitive destruction” is as powerful as anything in business. Having a moat is the only way to fight against the tide of competitive destruction. Michael Mauboussin, in what is arguably the best essay ever on moats, writes: “Companies generating high economic returns will attract competitors willing to take a lesser, albeit still attractive, return which will drive down aggregate industry returns to the opportunity cost of capital.” http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/measuringthemoat.pdf For example, if you open a successful clothing store that success will attract imitators and competitors. Through a process of “competitive destruction” some clothing stores will adapt and survive and thrive and others will fail. The consumer wins because the products and services offered to them get better and better. But this is a painful process for an investor since the outcome can be highly uncertain. It is also the hardest part for a businessperson since failure is an essential part of capitalism. Given the inevitability of relentless competition, the question to ask is according to Munger: “How do you compete against a true fanatic? You can only try to build the best possible moat and continuously attempt to widen it.” Poor Charlie’s Almanack at 59; http://www.scribd.com/doc/76907884/MOATS-abridged-1-5-70-chapters-a-preview Jim Sinegal of Costco is just such a fanatic which is why Charlie serves on their board. The founder of Nebraska Furniture Mart “Mrs. B” would be another fanatic. Charlie loves the management team at Iscar. Going down the list of Berkshire CEOs reveals a long list of fanatics. That moats are hard to create and usually deteriorate over time is one very important reason why capitalism works. What happens over time is so-called “producer surplus” is transferred into “consumer surplus”. Charlie describes the competitive process and why it benefits consumers as follows: “The major success of capitalism is its ability to drench business owners in feedback and allocate talent efficiently. If you have an area with 20 restaurants, and suddenly 18 are out of business, the remaining two are in good, capable hands. Business owners are constantly being reminded of benefits and punishments. That’s psychology explaining economics.” http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/07/02/charlie-mungers-thoughts-on-the-world-part-1.aspx Munger’s views on the nature of business competition are Darwinian: Capitalism does not pull its punches in markets that are genuinely competitive: “Over the very long-term, history shows that the chances of any business surviving in a manner agreeable to a company’s owners are slim at best.” http://www.valuewalk.com/charlie-munger-page/ “Capitalism is a pretty brutal place.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html When it comes to moats, durability matters. Munger wants to avoid a business that has a moat today, but is gone tomorrow. Some moats atrophy gradually over time and some much more quickly. This is not a completely new phenomenon. As Ernest Hemingway once said in his book The Sun Also Rises, a business can go bankrupt in two ways: gradually and then suddenly. The speed of moat destruction has accelerated over time due to advances in technology and the way it spreads information. For some people this increase in speed can at times be disorienting. For example, the speed at which a companies like Kodak or Nortel lost their moats has been shocking to many investors who grew up mostly in another era. The speed at which a moat disappears should not be confused with cases where a company never had a moat at all like Groupon. Hype about a sales “boiler room” selling coupons online is not a moat. Instead, that is an example of crowd folly (social proof + fake scarcity). Did Zygna ever have a moat or did it just evaporate quickly? It is hard to say. Sometimes causes are hard to tease apart. Facebook definitely has a moat, but once it ceased letting Zynga acquire customers cheaply by leveraging the Facebook moat, the tide arguably turned against Zynga. “To borrow someone’s moat is not to have a moat” might be the lesson of Zynga, since what is borrowed can be taken away. How long your moat lasts is called your “Competitive Advantage Period” (CAP) writes Michael Mauboussin. http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/FoFinance/Fof1.pdf The speed of moat dissipation will be different in each case and need not be constant. The rate at which a moat atrophies is similar to what academics call “fade” argues Mauboussin. Even the very best companies can see competition make their moats shrink or even disappear. Charlie has said: “Frequently, you’ll look at a business having fabulous results. And the question is, ‘How long can this continue?’ Well, there’s only one way I know to answer that. And that’s to think about why the results are occurring now - and then to figure out what could cause those results to stop occurring.” http://bitly.com/S5iN7K Sometimes what shrinks a moat is a shift of what Michael Porter has called “the Five Forces”. http://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy/ar/1 One such force is the power of distributors in a value chain: “Kellogg’s and Campbell’s moats have also shrunk due to the increased buying power of supermarkets and companies like Wal-Mart. The muscle power of Wal-Mart and Costco has increased dramatically.” http://www.tilsonfunds.com/motley_berkshire_brkmtg01notes.php3 When someone, such as a downstream distributor, takes a bigger slice of the amount of profit in the “profit pool,” bad things can happen if you are upstream. Whether that happens will depend on who has more bargaining power in that supply chain. A blogger in an essay discussed above recently argued that the Five Forces do not matter since consumers have more power. Consumers are one of the Five Forces so the argument is even at that level deeply misguided. Suppliers are also a potential problem. Try arguing that the Five Forces do not matter to the many music subscription companies that went bust due to the wholesale transfer pricing power of music suppliers. A restaurant owner who has had a landlord triple their rent knows very well that supplier bargaining power can be a huge problem. Yes, delighting customers is super important, no that does not help if your sole supplier is raising wholesale prices to take your profit. Sometimes it is buyers that have the ability to “holdup” the seller and sometimes it is the reverse depending on who has the bargaining power. Every aspect of a given business can be made worse if some firm or person in the value has more bargaining power. As an example, big movie stars have had huge wholesale transfer pricing power over the movie business value chain ever since the Hollywood studio system ended. Newspapers are a good example of an industry which once had a fantastic moat, which is now in decline. Unfortunately for newspapers, changes in technology have been taking down their moat in rather dramatic fashion. Charlie: “The perfectly fabulous economics of this [newspaper] business could become grievously impaired.” http://www.fool.com/BoringPort/2000/boringport00051501.htm Munger saw this deterioration before many other people did, mostly likely because Berkshire owned newspaper properties like The Washington Post and The Buffalo News. Berkshire has not given up on all types of newspapers. Papers that cover local news, particularly in a city with a strong sense of community are still attractive for Berkshire even in 2012. They said at the 2012 Berkshire meeting that they may buy more newspapers. These small city newspaper purchases seems to me like a Ben Graham “cigar butt” style investment and for that reason a reversion to an old investing style. But Berkshire have a *lot* of cash to put to work and only so many quality businesses to buy. Too much cash is, as some people say “A high quality problem.” Munger adds: “Excess cash in an advantage, not a disadvantage”. As a pool of investment dollars gets bigger it gets harder to find companies to buy or invest in that have a moat. In this sense size works against investment performance. More than one fund manager has suffered from this problem since the tendency is to ignore the need for a strong moat so you can get large amounts of money put to work. Kodak is a company which once had a strong moat and then began to lose it in dramatic fashion. Munger describes the competitive destruction that hit the photography business: “What happened to Kodak is a natural outcome of competitive capitalism.” http://www.businessinsider.com/munger-on-buffetts-cancer-the-fed-berkshires-investment-strategy-2012-5#ixzz2CB0ay5jG It is true that what happened to Kodak was rough, but the full story according to Munger should take into account that there was a part of Kodak that did have a moat and will survive: “People think the whole thing failed, but they forget that Kodak didn’t really go broke, because Eastman Chemical did survive as a prosperous company and they spun that off.” http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/22/buffett-munger-berkshire Why did Eastman Chemical survive? Most probably Eastman survived due to supply-side economies of scale and intellectual property. Kodak probably has some great patents for chemically-based photography too. But in the case of Kodak and photography the entire process changed to digital and the Kodak moat was swiftly gone. Research in Motion losing its Blackberry moat is another example of competitive destruction. Will they recover? The challenge the Blackberry faces is substantial. Once a feedback loop turns negative, it is hard for any company to regain what it once had. What builds you up can tear you down. And if the ride up was nonlinear, it is very possible that the ride down will be nonlinear as well. As another example, Munger has said that department stores in downtown areas once had a very strong moat given economies of scale and a central location near mass transit. But then the way people lived started to change as cars became more affordable and people migrated to suburbs with shopping centers. The arrival of Amazon.com has further damaged the moat of the big-box retailers of all kinds whether in the city or the suburbs. How Can the Quality of the Moat be Quantified? The test of whether you have a moat with a given company is quantitative (i.e., it’s a math-based test). If (1) you are earning profits that are greater than your weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and (2) that level of profitability has maintained for some reasonable period measured in years, you have a strong moat. If the size of the positive difference between ROIC and WACC is large and if that “spread” is persistent over time, your moat is relatively strong. Mauboussin is the one to read on this as is usual. The essay: Measuring the Moat at http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/measuringthemoat.pdf is a classic. Exactly how long the moat must be persistent to meet this test is an interesting question. If it is not a period of at least two years you are taking a significant risk. Five years of supporting data give you more certainty that you moat is sustainable. For a look at this see: What determines whether a business a company has a moat is qualitative (e.g., supply-side and demand-side economies of scale, brand, regulation and intellectual property) but how you test to determine the strength of your moat is quantitative (i.e., it’s a mathematical exercise). Mathematical formulas won’t tell you how to get a moat but they can help prove that you have one, at least for now. A company like Salesforce.com has not yet passed this quantitative test since management has been running their business at a loss or a tiny profit. Management at Salesforce.com can argue that they are doing this intentionally which seem to be true. But until Salesforce.com proves that it can pass the moat test with evidence that the mathematics satisfy the test, the assertion that the company has a moat is an unproven thesis. In other words, whether Salesforce.com has significant pricing power right now is just a theory. Until GAAP profit margins rise and stay high for a significant period the jury is still out. Any claims that prop0fiost have been earned non-GAAP basis or that the business generated or EBITDA (jokingly referred to by many people as “earnings before everything bad”) should be ignored. On this Munger has said: “I don’t even like to hear the word EBTDA.” He suggests inserting the word “bullshit” whenever you hear the term EBITDA Spotting the existence of a moat that has not been fully taken advantage of by its current ownership in terms of raising prices can be profitable for an investor buying that business. Warren Buffett points out: “There are actually businesses, that you will find a few times in a lifetime, where any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising prices — and yet they haven’t done it. So they have huge untapped pricing power that they’re not using. That is the ultimate no-brainer. … Disney found that it could raise those prices a lot and the attendance stayed right up. So a lot of the great record of Eisner and Wells … came from just raising prices at Disneyland and Disneyworld and through video cassette sales of classic animated movies… At Berkshire Hathaway, Warren and I raised the prices of See’s candy a little faster than others might have. And, of course, we invested in Coca-Cola — which had some untapped pricing power. And it also had brilliant management. So a Goizueta and Keough could do much more than raise prices. It was perfect.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html Starting with See’s Candies, Munger and Buffett learned that when you have a great moat (in this case driven by a powerful but primarily regional brand), the business can raise prices to improve profitability. On the December 29 of the year that they bought See’s prices were raised 20-30 cents a pound. They also learned that some brands translate less well to new markets and there is a limit on how many stores one can profitably build in a given geographic area. Buffett has said that Kellogg’s has at times pushed their pricing too far and damaged their moat. Buffet believes that they didn’t have the moat they thought they had versus General Mills and other major breakfast cereal competitors. At a very practical level the discussion above illustrates that there are some rules of thumb one can use to test the strength of a moat. At the top of the list is whether the business has pricing power. For example, if you must hold a prayer meeting before you try to raise prices, then you don’t have much of a moat, if any, argues Buffett. Finally, it should be emphasized that is nothing sinister about the term “moat.” Business is, by its very nature, a competitive process. Even a small restaurant selling barbecue can have a moat. A company that has a return on capital significantly greater than their opportunity cost over time has a moat whether they know it or not. That’s enough about moats for now. The next post will be about Munger’s Investment Filters Two and Three: Circle of Competence and Management with Integrity and Talent. Charlie Munger on Mistakes Charlie Munger on “Circle of Competence” (The Second Essential Filter) Categories: Uncategorized\n\n“The difference between a good business and a bad business it is that good businesses throw up one easy decision after another. The bad businesses throw up painful decisions time after time.” http://bit.ly/S5iN7K\n\nWhy do some businesses create easy decisions? The answer lies in microeconomics: if there is no significant “barrier to entry” which creates what Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter calls a “sustainable competitive advantage” (a “moat” in Berkshire parlance), competition will cause return on investment for that business to drop to opportunity cost and there will be no economic profit for the producer. The analogy they use at Berkshire is that the business itself is the equivalent of the “castle” and the value of that castle will be determined by the strength of the “moat.”\n\nThe need for a business to have a “moat” is so strong that Munger has made it one of the “four essential filters” he uses in deciding whether to invest in a given business. The four essential filters are:\n\nA business with a moat,\n\nA business that can be understood by the investor,\n\nManagement in place with integrity and talent, and\n\nA business that can be bought at an attractive price that gives an attractive margin of safety. http://www.psyfitec.com/2009/10/buffett-and-munger-on-bbc.html\n\nBefore examining each of these four essential filters one-by one, it is important to point out that these “four skills” below which relate to moats are very different that the four essential filters themselves:\n\nCreating a moat which is something that people like Ray Kroc, Sam Walton Estee Lauder, Mary Kay Ash and Bill Gates have accomplished. Moat creation requires superior management skill always combined with some degree of luck. It is theoretically possible to acquire a moat with no management talent and just luck but I can’t think of an example of this ever happening. Sometimes people who are fantastic managers who have the ability to create a moat have very poor skills when it comes to investing. Stock promoters love these people since they are big targets for scams.\n\nIdentifying a moat that others have created which is something that people like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett can do. Munger admits that he and Warren Buffett buy moats rather than build them since building them is not something they do particularly well. In addition to a moat Charlie insists that there be a talented management team already in place. For an investor who buys moats instead of creating one, the existence of a moat has special value since they can sometimes survive financially even if management talent does not deliver as expected or if they leave the business.\n\nIdentifying a startup that may acquire a moat before it is evident which is something that some venture capitalists can do at a sufficiently high level of probability that they can generate an attractive return on capital overall. This skill is very rare as evidenced by the fact that the distribution of returns in venture capital is a power law. Moats that emerge from complex adaptive systems like an economy are hard to spot since a moat is something that greater than the sum of the parts emerging from something else that is greater than the sum of its parts. In contrast, a moat being destroyed is easier to spot since it is a process of something transforming into nothing.\n\nDescribing a moat in academic terms which is something that someone like Michael Porter can do. Why this is a rare talent in academia is a puzzle. The reason for this is that simple theories are not the sort of things that will get a person a tenured faculty position. This essay could go on for many pages quoting Munger railing about deficiencies in academia. Here are just two:\n\n“I was recently speaking with Jack McDonald, who teaches a course on investing rooted in our principles at Stanford Business School. He said it’s lonely — like he’s the Maytag repairman.” http://www.fool.com/boringport/2000/boringport00051500.htm “\n\nWarren once said to me, “I’m probably misjudging academia generally [in thinking so poorly of it] because the people who interact with me have bonkers theories.” … We’re trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low - or even a fair price. The reason the professors teach such nonsense is that if they didn’t], what would they teach the rest of the semester?” http://www.tilsonfunds.com/motley_berkshire_wescomeetings.php (2004)\n\nEach of these four skills which relate to moats is very different and it is unusual for a person to have all four skills. Many people just have one. More importantly, well over 90% of the population of the world has none of these skills. Tragically for them, the population that thinks they have this set of skills is far higher than 10%. For society, this overconfidence is valuable since “even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while” via luck.\n\nMerely because a person can identify that a given company has a moat does not mean that they have any ability to create a moat as a manager. At the 2012 Berkshire meeting Munger admitted that the brand-based moats which Berkshire has are bought rather than created. The ability to spot a moat that someone else created is very different from the ability to create a moat, believes Munger. You don’t need to know how to make hamburgers to spot that McDonald’s’ has a moat, but don’t try to build a business like McDonald’s without the abilities that Ray Kroc had.\n\nAt the 2012 Berkshire meeting Charlie said:\n\n“We buy barriers. Building them is tough… Our great brands aren’t anything we’ve created. We’ve bought them. If you’re buying something at a huge discount to its replacement value and it is hard to replace, you have a big advantage. One competitor is enough to ruin a business running on small margins.” http://gongol.com/research/berkshire/2012/\n\nSometimes great managers can transition to become great venture capitalists and sometimes not. As another example, Michael Porter has done a great job taking some fundamental ideas from microeconomics and introducing it to business schools, but I would not give him five cents to start a business or invest money on my behalf. Perhaps he is a good manager or investor but I have zero data to indicate that this might be true other than he has described some important principles in an academic way.\n\nRecently someone argued on a blog that because some academics affiliated with Michael Porter’s theory on sustainable competitive advantage do not have the management skill required to create a moat themselves, that “sustainable competitive advantage simply doesn’t exist” other than created by government regulation. http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/11/20/what-killed-michael-porters-monitor-group-the-one-force-that-really-matters/ First and most importantly, as will be explained below, the test of whether a moat exist is quantitative (it is a 100% math-based test). The simple of mathematics reveals that many companies have moats in many sectors of the economy that have existed for many years. Second, as I have explained above, not everyone has all four skills that relate to moats. That a team of academics can’t create a moat does not mean sustainable competitive advantage does not exist. The act of successfully creating a moat is a rare event. Berkshire’s portfolio of companies alone (e.g., See’s Candies) proves that moats are sustainable for a very long time. Google and Oracle are just two of many companies that have generated sustained profitability that meets the test for a moat.\n\nThe blogger’s own thesis is that companies should continuously innovate instead. That Porter’s work would not support the need to constantly innovate, create new value or disrupt your own business is a baffling conclusion. The two issues are orthogonal. The thesis that Clayton Christensen’s work invalidates the work of his fellow professor at Harvard Business School Michael Porter is simply false. That profit is hard to sustain does not mean that it is impossible to sustain. Nowhere does Michael Porter say that a moat can be maintained forever.\n\nThe blogger’s thesis also suffers in that it has no predictive power. It is consistent with the sort of promotion that you see around hyped IPOs. “It’s disruptive!” is not a substitute for profit unless your goal is to flip the business to someone else. Disruption alone without anything behind it is the management equivalent of EBITDA.\n\nClayton Christensen’s work around disruptive innovation is super important and wise (you will see links to it below), but don’t kid yourself that disruption without a moat will necessarily lead to actual GAAP profit. Disruption is a fantastic place to look for profit whether the business is a startup or an established business, but sometimes profit is just not there. If you don’t have a moat somewhere and are unable to flip your company to a greater fool or a company that is already profitable who needs it for defensive reasons, you will soon fall prey to the only unforgivable sin in business: running out of cash. Giving away everything for free while generating zero profit is at best an interim strategy or a description of the Java business model that Sun adopted.\n\nDo some companies create something so disruptive that benefits consumers so much that someone must buy that service or product to stay competitive even though it generates no incremental profit? Absolutely. But in such a case only consumers benefit since only positive outcome is the creation of consumer surplus. Producer surplus for that disruptive innovation can be zero or less than zero. That is part of the reason why capitalism benefits consumers. To offer a “loss leader” you must in the medium term at least have a base business that generates a profit that is tied to that loss. But I am getting ahead of myself. You can read more on disruption in a futurepost.\n\nReturning to the discussion of the four essential filters, whether a business has a durable moat is without question the most important filter for an investor like Charlie whose chosen profession is buying moats. For example, Charlie describes a moat in three different ways immediately below, each emphasizing the importance of the moat being able to maintain itself over time.\n\n“We have to have a business with some inherent characteristics that give it a durable competitive advantage.” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XlBrohrIUc\n\n“The number one idea is to view a stock as an ownership of the business and to judge the staying quality of the business in terms of its competitive advantage.” http://www.valuewalk.com/charlie-munger-page/\n\n“We’re trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low - or even a fair price.”\n\nCharlie may reference another of the four essential filters in a statement but invariably the requirement of a moat is present in his statement. My belief is that of the four filters, nothing is more essential than moat. The second filter is about reducing the number of mistakes made and filters three and four essentially layer on a “margin of safety” when making an investment. In other words, moats are the foundation of Munger’s investment process and methodology. Everything starts with the moat (or lack of a moat) for Charlie because he does not create moats, he buys them.\n\nComponents of a Moat:\n\nMunger has not explained his theories on what causes a moat as comprehensively as Warren Buffett, but he has made some comments that point people in the right direction. In addition there are all the companies in the Berkshire portfolio that illustrate what a moat is, like Geico, Burlington Northern, See’s Candies.\n\nThe primary components of a moat that Charlie has talked about are as follows:\n\n1. Supply-Side Economies of Scale\n\nThere are two types of “economies of scale” and the first is supply-side economies of scale. A large firm that is part of an oligopolistic market will generate significant supply-side economies of scale in its production of goods and services as per-unit costs fall with increasing output. Due to factors like the difficulty of managing large firms, economies of scale ar exhausted well before those firms from dominate the entire market.” The economists Varian and Shapiro in their book Information Rules write about supply-side economies of scale via an example: “Despite its supply-side economies of scale, General Motors never grew to take over the entire automobile market.”\n\nSamsung is reaping the benefits of supply-side economies of scale as does Intel. Clayton Christensen argues that the worship false accounting gods like RONA have caused many companies to outsource tasks like the semiconductor fabrication and lose important supply- side economies. He argues that outsourcing has harmed many companies in the long-term even though in the short-term it may have seemed wise. http://gartner.mediasite.com/mediasite/play/9cfe6bba5c7941e09bee95eb63f769421d\n\nIn Charlie’s view Wal-Mart has massive supply-side economies of scale through its investments in distribution and other systems. These and other Wal-Mart investments have given the company a moat. Wal-Mart also possesses a high degree of operational effectiveness which adds it its profitability. Like Wal-Mart companies which operate huge steel plants and shipyards can have supply-side economies of scale. Markets like these tend to end up as part of an oligopoly since supply-side advantages only go so far to consolidate an industry.\n\nMunger described two different supply-side economies of scale below:\n\n“On the subject of economies of scale, I find chain stores quite interesting. Just think about it. The concept of a chain store was a fascinating invention. You get this huge purchasing power — which means that you have lower merchandise costs. You get a whole bunch of little laboratories out there in which you can conduct experiments. And you get specialization. If one little guy is trying to buy across 27 different merchandise categories influenced by traveling salesmen, he’s going to make a lot of dumb decisions. But if you’re buying is done in headquarters for a huge bunch of stores, you can get very bright people who know a lot about refrigerators and so forth to do the buying. The reverse is demonstrated by the little store where one guy is doing all the buying. So there are huge purchasing advantages.\n\nSome [supply-side advantages] come from simple geometry. If you’re building a great circular tank, obviously as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface goes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of steel. There are all kinds of things like that where the simple geometry - the simple reality - gives you an advantage of scale.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html\n\nMunger explains below how changes that have taken place in the advertising industry, which perhaps explain why Procter & Gamble has started to struggle more than it has in the past in delivering the same level of profitability:\n\n“You can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. When TV advertising first arrived - when talking color pictures first came into our living rooms - it was an unbelievably powerful thing. And in the early days, we had three networks that had whatever it was - say 90% of the audience. Well, if you were Procter & Gamble, you could afford to use this new method of advertising. You could afford the very expensive cost of network television because you were selling so damn many cans and bottles. Some little guy couldn’t. And there was no way of buying it in part. Therefore, he couldn’t use it. In effect, if you didn’t have a big volume, you couldn’t use network TV advertising - which was the most effective technique. So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge tail wind.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html\n\nThis may also explain in part why Berkshire has dropped its stake in Johnson and Johnson to very low levels. Johnson and Johnson has been a lagging performer for Berkshire and is now out of favor with Munger and Buffett.\n\nAlthough Berkshire was a bit late to appreciate the attractiveness to an investor of the railroad business, Munger and Buffett clearly value the moat that supply-side economies scale creates in the railroad business. A new competitor in the railroad business is highly unlikely. As the public roads deteriorate as the United States underinvests in infrastructure and energy prices rise, railroads will get even more competitive. Munger has said:\n\n“Do you know what it would cost to replace Burlington Northern today? We are not going to build another transcontinental. And those assets are valuable, have utility. Now they want to raise diesel prices on trucks. … We finally realized that railroads now have a huge competitive advantage, with double stacked rail cars, guided by computers, moving more and more production from China, etc. They have a big advantage over truckers in huge classes of business. http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf\n\nRailroads are interesting in that long ago they were a growth industry that both created great fortunes and great busts in the aftermath of that success. There were times in history when railroads were very lousy investments.\n\nRegarding the impact of supply-side economies of scale Charlie has pointed out:\n\n“In some businesses, the very nature of things cascades toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm. It tends to cascade to a winner take all result. And these advantages of scale are so great, for example, that when Jack Welch came into General Electric, he just said, ‘to hell with it. We’re either going to be number one or two in every field we’re in or we’re going to be out’. That was a very tough-minded thing to do, but I think it was a correct decision if you’re thinking about maximizing shareholder wealth.”\n\nBerkshire has recently sold nearly all of its shares in GE, which is a reminder that moats come and go as time passes and conditions change. People who follow Munger and Buffett might have laughed not too long ago if someone were to have predicted that GE would lose favor with Berkshire.\n\n2. Demand-side Economies of Scale (Network Effects):\n\nDemand-side economies of scale (also known as “network effects”) result when a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it. Unlike supply-side economies of scale, network effects can be (1) nonlinear and (2) continue to accrue to benefit the company for far longer. Given a choice between supply-side economies of scale and demand-side economies of scale, it is preferable to have the latter. Varian and Shapiro in their book Information Rules write: “Unlike the supply-side economies of scale, demand-side economies of scale don’t dissipate when the market gets large enough.”\n\neBay, Craigslist, Twitter, Facebook and other multi-sided markets have demand-side economies of scale that operate on their behalf. My view is that ESPN also has demand-side economies of scale, most notable for Sports Center, since the more people who watch the ESPN channels, the more valuable the channels are to each user since those particular images will be the basis of discussion for sports fanatics. Fox and other sports channels just can’t replicate that demand side effects since when someone says “did you see X do Y in the Z game?” If you watched Fox version of Sports Center, you may not have seen the particular video clip.\n\nGoogle has at least two beneficial demand-side economies of scale (one for search and one for advertising targeting) that are mutually reinforcing that give it a strong moat according. Munger has said:\n\n“Google has a huge new moat. In fact I’ve probably never seen such a wide moat.” http://seekingalpha.com/article/140485-would-buffett-consider-google-a-great-investment\n\n“I don’t know how you displace Google but a lot of the other companies will have competitive troubles.” http://www.investingdaily.com/11313/google-up-13-on-great-earnings-and-google-is-facebook-in-trouble\n\nSome companies have both demand and supply-side economies of scale. Amazon has both supply-side and demand-side economies of scale and they reinforce each other. For example, the more people who provide comments on Amazon the more valuable it becomes to other users due to demand-side economies. Amazon also has huge advantages on warehouses and the supply chain on the supply-side.\n\nThere are both weak and strong supply-side demand-side economies of scale and they fall along a continuum in terms of relative strength. Most companies have both supply-side and demand-side economies. The “holy grail” for an entrepreneur is demand-side economies of scale that can cause a market to “tip” and give almost the entire market to one company. The reality is that most demand-side economies do not cause a market to “tip.” For example, GM’s cars were better to a degree at one point since the more people who owned the cars, the easier auto parts were to get, but weak demand-side economies like that were not strong enough to make the market “tip.”\n\nIf a market does “tip” and a competitor is the one to reap those benefits, things can go really wrong, really fast. For example, MySpace started to monetize before the social networking market “tipped” and MySpace paid the price and Facebook reaped the rewards. Facebook held off monetizing until its moat was secure. Zuckerberg was patient about waiting for the market to tip and Rupert Murdoch was not.\n\nOne illustrative example can be found in the cement industry. Cemex’s cement business gets better the more trucks it has in play in a given geographic area. The service gets cheaper with supply-side scale due to lower COGS (e.g., less gas consumed), it gets better (faster delivery times) due to demand-side economies. And that combination of supply and demand-side economies creates a barrier to entry that helps Cemex.\n\nWhich came first, the faster supply of cement to contractors due to more plants (the egg) or greater demand from contractors due to faster delivery times (the chicken)? I believe Cemex intentionally created an egg, knowing there would be greater demand for the service. This solution to the “chicken and egg” problem is typical in multi-sided markets. However, in this case the Cemex demand-side economies were not strong enough to make their market for cement tip.\n\nMy thesis about Chinese restaurants is similar: When you have more customers for Chinese food, the food turns over faster and so it is fresher and better, holding the level of cooking constant. More customers for Chinese food not only lowers cost of goods sold (COGS) since they buy in volume, but increases quality. But a market like this is not going to tip\n\nAs another example, Costco is a better value the more its “store geographic scope” and density increases since I can, for example, use it when visiting relative in another state. Costco also has supply-side economies of scale. Since a market like Costco is in is not going to tip and so oligopoly is likely.\n\nIt could be argued that Cemex, GM and Chinese restaurants with high volumes have some demand-side economies of scale in addition to their supply-side economies of scale. But the demand-side economies are not strong enough to tip to one dominant supplier. Lots of other industries are similar. Credit card markets did not tip enough to prevent multiple providers. Car rentals did not tip and are instead an oligopoly.\n\nSupply-side economies of scale can be really powerful. The jet turbine makers have supply-side advantages that makes them very profitable. Are there advantages to customers of easier access to parts if they buy a Rolls Royce jet turbine that might create some demand-side benefits? Sure. But can China open its checkbook and create a new jet engine competitor? I think so. In the case of jet turbines supply-side benefits are strong, but demand-side benefits are weak.\n\nAmerican Express is another company in the Berkshire portfolio with demand-side economies of scale since the more merchants accept their card the more valuable the service gets and the more people who use the card the more valuable the services is for merchants. Munger continues to believe American Express has a moat despite the rise of upstarts like Square.\n\n“It would be easier to screw up American Express than Coke or Gillette, but it’s an immensely strong business.” http://www.fool.com/boringport/2000/boringport000501a.htm\n\nVisa has a similar moat to American Express as does PayPal. But challengers like Square may change the game enough to take significant share. eBay’s moat is definitely demand-side driven on its original business as well.\n\nA company having beneficial network effects is only one dimension that impacts profit. Sometimes network effects are there but the market is small since it is a niche. Amazon’s market is bigger and that matters greatly in terms of the market capitalization it can generate. Some network effects are very strong like Google’s and sometimes they are weaker like for web sites that crowd source reviews which contain a lot of noise that is hard to automate out.\n\nAt the 2011 meeting of Wesco held just before it was merged into Berkshire Hathaway, Munger admitted that he and Buffett really did not understand the value of a brand until they bought See’s Candies. The two investors found after they bought See’s Candies they could regularly raise prices and customers did not seem to care. Buffett and Munger call this ability “pricing power.” Munger notes that before See’s Candies:\n\n“We didn’t know the power of a good brand. Over time we just discovered that we could raise prices 10% a year and no one cared. Learning this changed Berkshire. It was really important.” http://theinvestmentsblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/final-wesco-meeting-morning-with.htm\n\nSee’s Candies is also a great A/B test on brand power. To illustrate, if you grew up in a home that bought See’s Candies (mostly on the West Coast, especially in California) and experiences around that candy have very favorable associations, you will pay more for that boxed candy brand.\n\nSomeone who grew up in the east cost of the United States is going to shop for boxed candy and not attribute much value to the brand since they do not have those same experiences. For this reason, See’s has found it hard to expand regionally and has done so very slowly..\n\nSee’s Candies can also only sell so much candy at that price given the choices it has made. People don’t usually go to a See’s Candies store because they are hungry for food. The box/gift candy business is very seasonal. What See’s sells is not just food, but rather an experience. See’s generates losses two quarters a year and makes all its profit in the other two quarters around three holidays.\n\nBuffett talks about the fact that building some brands took many decades:\n\n“When you were a 16-year-old, you took a box of candy on your first date with a girl and gave it either to her parents or to her. I California the girls slap you when you bring Russell Stover, and kiss you when you bring See’s.”… “I don’t think See’s means anything to people on the East Coast, where people are also exposed to higher-end chocolate products.” http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/22/sees-candies-buffett-berkshire/\n\nWhile some of the power of a brand can come from taste, modern “flavor” firms can replicate most any taste. Trade dress and presentation of a good or service matters more than ever. A lot of Tiffany’s brand power is the blue box the jewelry comes in. Coke made a massive mistake thinking it was flavor in a blind taste test that mattered when it introduced the New Coke. When the taste test is not blind Coke wins and when it is blind Coke does not win. Munger said once about the New Coke episode:\n\n“[Coke spent] 100 years getting people to believe that trademark had all these intangible values too. And people associate it with a flavor…. Pepsi was within weeks of coming out with old Coke in a Pepsi bottle, which would’ve been the biggest fiasco in modern times. Perfect insanity.” http://www.rbcpa.com/Mungerspeech_june_95.pdf\n\nAlthough it is not currently doing as well financially as it has in the past, Charlie has admired Procter & Gamble since:\n\n“They just make a fortune on some of the body products. Some of these brands, I mean, if you can make something that actually improves the skin, wow. That’s the last thing people will give up”. http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/22/buffett-munger-berkshire\n\nAs was noted above, it can be argued that TV does not give Procter & Gamble the same benefits supply-side economies in television since post Internet there are so many ways to advertise that do not require supply-side scale. The argument would be that smaller firms and store brands are making big inroads by using new forms of marketing and Procter & Gamble suffers from that new competition as their brand is weakened.\n\nAs another example, Charlie said once that customer loyalty to Costco is a big part of their moat:\n\n“If you get hooked on going to Costco with your family, you’ll go there for the rest of your life.” http://bitly.com/YsZny5\n\nI am skeptical that “getting hooked” is a brand advantage and instead suspect that Costco’s moat is more about great business execution by Costco plus supply-side economies of scale. The Costco brand is valuable, but not enough by itself to fully explain its profitability. Most moats are caused by multiple factors. Clayton Christensen makes a very powerful argument that companies like Costco, Zara and Ikea create a moat by integrating around “a job” that a customer need to get done. You can hear Clayton make that argument here in this video: http://gartner.mediasite.com/mediasite/play/9cfe6bba5c7941e09bee95eb63f769421d It sounds similar to arguments that Michael Porter makes about the value of integration of all the aspects of what a company does, but around a task. Perhaps Berkshire believes that this is a source of a moat for Well Fargo.\n\nA moat powered by a brand is something very different from one created via supply-side economies of scale. For example, Warren Buffett has said that for a company like Disney when the brand is mentioned in conversation “you have something in your mind.” He adds:\n\n“How would you try to create a brand that competes with Disney? Coke is a brand associated with people being happy around the world. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the moat. You want that moat to widen.” http://investdigest.blogspot.com/2005/12/untapped-pricing-power-and-share-of.html\n\nOne company that is puzzling is the eyeglass maker Luxottica’s (brands like Ray-Ban, Oakley, Persol and other major brands). How that eyeglass company can have that much market share since it has so many brands is unusual. There must be supply-side economies that are driving that business. I just don’t see any real significant demand-side economies that might explain Luxottica’s level of success. Could is be that they reap a lot of benefits from organization around a job a customer need to get done. Perhaps, but that seems to be a stretch.\n\nBrands of course can fail over time. Put a luxury brand on a table or shelf in Costco as some have done and that luxury brand is damaged. License it too broadly and the brand is also damaged. Buffett and Munger see attracted to brand that they use in their own lives. See’s and Dairy Queen are just two examples.\n\nSome brands incur problems with their brand that are completely self-inflected. Buffett went on to say about one his most favorite brands:\n\n“Take See’s candy. You cannot destroy the brand of See’s candy. Only See’s can do that. You have to look at the brand as a promise to the customer that we are going to offer the quality and service that is expected. We link the product with happiness. You don’t see See’s candy sponsoring the local funeral home. We are at the Thanksgiving Day Parades though.” http://www.buffettfaq.com/\n\nRegarding brand power, the two Berkshire leaders have often cited Wrigley’s as a brand that creates strong moat. Munger has pointed out:\n\n“The informational advantage of brands is hard to beat. And your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley chewing gum alongside Glotz’s chewing gum. Well, I know that Wrigley is a satisfactory product, whereas I don’t know anything about Glotz’s. So if one is $.40 and the other is $.30, am I going to take something I don’t know and put it in my mouth - which is a pretty personal place, after all - for a lousy dime? So, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well-known, has advantages of scale - what you might call an informational advantage.\n\nEveryone is influenced by what others do and approve. Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term “social proof”. We are all influenced - subconsciously and to some extent consciously - by what we see others do and approve. Therefore, if everybody’s buying something, we think it’s better. We don’t like to be the one guy who’s out of step. Again, some of this is at a subconscious level and some of it isn’t. Sometimes, we consciously and rationally think, “Gee, I don’t know much about this. They know more than I do. Therefore, why shouldn’t I follow them?” All told, your advantages can add up to one tough moat.” http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf\n\nA very important test for Buffett and Munger in determining the strength of a brand- based moat is whether a competitor can replicate or weaken the moat with a massive checkbook. As just one example, here is what Buffett said about Coke at the 2012 Berkshire meeting: “If you gave me $10, $20, $30 billion to knock off Coca-Cola, I couldn’t do it.”\n\nFirms like Nike and BMW each have brands that help maintain their moat that were hard to get and super valuable to have. The creation of a great brand is a rare thing and requires considerable skill and arguably a big dose of luck as well. Charlie has pointed out: “China has great companies already. Just not great brand names yet.” I would quibble with Munger’s conclusion in that the Huawei brand is already strong already in certain business markets. And Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei are making brand inroads in mobile phones. China will in my view surely have many strong global brands over the long-term.\n\n4. Regulation:\n\nThere are certain businesses which have created a competence with regard to regulation that is so high that regulation actually serves as a barrier to entry/moat for their competitors. Rather than helping consumers in these cases on a net basis regulations can end up protecting producers and creating a moat. For example, some people believe banks have created such a powerful layer of regulatory expertise that the regulators have become “captured” by the industry they regulate. There are a number of professional; guilds like lawyers who have been able to use regulation to limit supply.\n\nFor Berkshire, the regulation-driven moat that Moody’s had in the bond rating business was a big attraction. To issue bonds regulators actually require that the issuer get an opinion from a very small number of bond rating firms which means the rating firms Moody’s, S&P and Fitch have a moat. Fannie and Freddie also had regulatory created moats, but the result for them in the end was not good.\n\nWhen regulation disappears, it often becomes quickly evident that it was a major factor in industry profitability. You find out who is otherwise swimming naked when the regulatory-driven moat disappears. For example, said Munger:\n\n“[Airline] Competition was so intense that, once it was unleashed by deregulation, ravaged shareholder wealth in the airline business” http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf\n\nMunger once described airlines as “marginal cost with wings.” http://bitly.com/RzDIys People talk about Virgin Airlines having a great brand and better service, but where are the profits? How long will it be before other airlines begin to imitate the Emirates strategy? Where is the barrier to entry for an airline? You can lease jets and gates. Munger and Buffett have said repeatedly over the years that they hate a commodity business. They learned this lesson the hard way by investing in firms like the New England textile manufacturer that gave Berkshire its name. Buffett ignores insurance lines that are commodities as another example\n\nReturning to the subject of regulatory capture, Berkshire invests so much money in Well Fargo is interesting since arguably the sorts of banking that Wells Fargo does is a commodity business. It can be argued that Wells Fargo benefits from regulation since it is “too big to fail” and therefore has a lower cost of capital than it would otherwise which gives it a moat. We will discuss Wells Fargo again in a future post when the subject of management is covered.\n\n5. Patents and Intellectual Property\n\nCompanies which have been granted a patent or other type of intellectual property by a government have in effect been given a legal monopoly. While the justifications for doing so are not the subject of this discussion, this barrier to entry can create a substantial moat for the holder of the intellectual property. Munger has said:\n\n“… In microeconomics, of course, you’ve got the concept of patents, trademarks, exclusive franchises and so forth. Patents are quite interesting. When I was young, I think more money went into patents than came out. Judges tended to throw them out - based on arguments about what was really invented and what relied on prior art. That isn’t altogether clear. But they changed that. They didn’t change the laws. They just changed the administration - so that it all goes to one patent court. And that court is now very much more pro-patent. So I think people are now starting to make a lot of money out of owning patents. But trademarks and franchises have always been great. Trademarks, of course, have always made people a lot of money. A trademark system is a wonderful thing for a big operation if it’s well-known.” http://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/The-Best-of-Charlie-Munger-1994-2011.pdf\n\nQualcomm is an example of a company which has created a moat mostly via intellectual property. Qualcomm has so many patents and has managed to get them embedded inside enough important wireless industry standards which have their own demand-side economies of scales, that the company has created a substantial moat.\n\nOne example of a company that Berkshire values higher due to intellectual property patents is Lubrizol. Initially Buffett said:\n\n“It struck me as a business I didn’t know anything about initially. You know, you’re talking about petroleum additives… Are there competitive moats, is there ease of entry, all that sort of thing. I did not have any understanding of that at all initially. And I talked to Charlie a few days later…and Charlie says, ‘I don’t understand it either.’” http://advisoranalyst.com/glablog/tag/cnbc-interview/\n\nBut eventually Buffett was won over and made the Lubrizol purchase.\n\n“I decided there’s probably a good size moat on this. They’ve got lots and lots of patents, but more than that they have a connection with customers.” http://advisoranalyst.com/glablog/tag/cnbc-interview/\n\nAt the 2011 Berkshire meeting Buffet reiterated that he decided to go ahead since he thought that the more than 1,600 patents held by Lubrizol would give the company “a durable competitive advantage.”\n\nAnother example of intellectual property proving its value for Munger occurred in the 1970s when Russell Stover Candies started to open stores in markets served by See’s Candies with very similar appearance. The use of the distinctive “trade dress” of See’s Candies was enough of a violation of the law that Munger was able through threat of litigation to get agreement from Russell Stover Candies to stop what they were doing and the moat was proven to be durable.\n\nThe Nature of Competition and Moats:\n\nIn Charlie’s view, even if you currently have a good business that does not mean you will have it for very long. This puts the durability of a given moat at risk. The process of what Joseph Schumpeter called “competitive destruction” is as powerful as anything in business. Having a moat is the only way to fight against the tide of competitive destruction.\n\nMichael Mauboussin, in what is arguably the best essay ever on moats, writes:\n\n“Companies generating high economic returns will attract competitors willing to take a lesser, albeit still attractive, return which will drive down aggregate industry returns to the opportunity cost of capital.” http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/measuringthemoat.pdf\n\nFor example, if you open a successful clothing store that success will attract imitators and competitors. Through a process of “competitive destruction” some clothing stores will adapt and survive and thrive and others will fail. The consumer wins because the products and services offered to them get better and better. But this is a painful process for an investor since the outcome can be highly uncertain. It is also the hardest part for a businessperson since failure is an essential part of capitalism.\n\nGiven the inevitability of relentless competition, the question to ask is according to Munger:\n\n“How do you compete against a true fanatic? You can only try to build the best possible moat and continuously attempt to widen it.” Poor Charlie’s Almanack at 59; http://www.scribd.com/doc/76907884/MOATS-abridged-1-5-70-chapters-a-preview\n\nJim Sinegal of Costco is just such a fanatic which is why Charlie serves on their board. The founder of Nebraska Furniture Mart “Mrs. B” would be another fanatic. Charlie loves the management team at Iscar. Going down the list of Berkshire CEOs reveals a long list of fanatics.\n\nThat moats are hard to create and usually deteriorate over time is one very important reason why capitalism works. What happens over time is so-called “producer surplus” is transferred into “consumer surplus”. Charlie describes the competitive process and why it benefits consumers as follows:\n\n“The major success of capitalism is its ability to drench business owners in feedback and allocate talent efficiently. If you have an area with 20 restaurants, and suddenly 18 are out of business, the remaining two are in good, capable hands. Business owners are constantly being reminded of benefits and punishments. That’s psychology explaining economics.” http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/07/02/charlie-mungers-thoughts-on-the-world-part-1.aspx\n\nMunger’s views on the nature of business competition are Darwinian: Capitalism does not pull its punches in markets that are genuinely competitive:\n\n“Over the very long-term, history shows that the chances of any business surviving in a manner agreeable to a company’s owners are slim at best.” http://www.valuewalk.com/charlie-munger-page/\n\n“Capitalism is a pretty brutal place.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html\n\nWhen it comes to moats, durability matters. Munger wants to avoid a business that has a moat today, but is gone tomorrow. Some moats atrophy gradually over time and some much more quickly. This is not a completely new phenomenon. As Ernest Hemingway once said in his book The Sun Also Rises, a business can go bankrupt in two ways: gradually and then suddenly. The speed of moat destruction has accelerated over time due to advances in technology and the way it spreads information. For some people this increase in speed can at times be disorienting. For example, the speed at which a companies like Kodak or Nortel lost their moats has been shocking to many investors who grew up mostly in another era.\n\nThe speed at which a moat disappears should not be confused with cases where a company never had a moat at all like Groupon. Hype about a sales “boiler room” selling coupons online is not a moat. Instead, that is an example of crowd folly (social proof + fake scarcity). Did Zygna ever have a moat or did it just evaporate quickly? It is hard to say. Sometimes causes are hard to tease apart. Facebook definitely has a moat, but once it ceased letting Zynga acquire customers cheaply by leveraging the Facebook moat, the tide arguably turned against Zynga. “To borrow someone’s moat is not to have a moat” might be the lesson of Zynga, since what is borrowed can be taken away.\n\nHow long your moat lasts is called your “Competitive Advantage Period” (CAP) writes Michael Mauboussin. http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/FoFinance/Fof1.pdf The speed of moat dissipation will be different in each case and need not be constant. The rate at which a moat atrophies is similar to what academics call “fade” argues Mauboussin.\n\nEven the very best companies can see competition make their moats shrink or even disappear. Charlie has said:\n\n“Frequently, you’ll look at a business having fabulous results. And the question is, ‘How long can this continue?’ Well, there’s only one way I know to answer that. And that’s to think about why the results are occurring now - and then to figure out what could cause those results to stop occurring.” http://bitly.com/S5iN7K\n\nSometimes what shrinks a moat is a shift of what Michael Porter has called “the Five Forces”. http://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy/ar/1 One such force is the power of distributors in a value chain:\n\n“Kellogg’s and Campbell’s moats have also shrunk due to the increased buying power of supermarkets and companies like Wal-Mart. The muscle power of Wal-Mart and Costco has increased dramatically.” http://www.tilsonfunds.com/motley_berkshire_brkmtg01notes.php3\n\nWhen someone, such as a downstream distributor, takes a bigger slice of the amount of profit in the “profit pool,” bad things can happen if you are upstream. Whether that happens will depend on who has more bargaining power in that supply chain.\n\nA blogger in an essay discussed above recently argued that the Five Forces do not matter since consumers have more power. Consumers are one of the Five Forces so the argument is even at that level deeply misguided. Suppliers are also a potential problem. Try arguing that the Five Forces do not matter to the many music subscription companies that went bust due to the wholesale transfer pricing power of music suppliers. A restaurant owner who has had a landlord triple their rent knows very well that supplier bargaining power can be a huge problem. Yes, delighting customers is super important, no that does not help if your sole supplier is raising wholesale prices to take your profit.\n\nSometimes it is buyers that have the ability to “holdup” the seller and sometimes it is the reverse depending on who has the bargaining power. Every aspect of a given business can be made worse if some firm or person in the value has more bargaining power. As an example, big movie stars have had huge wholesale transfer pricing power over the movie business value chain ever since the Hollywood studio system ended.\n\nNewspapers are a good example of an industry which once had a fantastic moat, which is now in decline. Unfortunately for newspapers, changes in technology have been taking down their moat in rather dramatic fashion. Charlie:\n\n“The perfectly fabulous economics of this [newspaper] business could become grievously impaired.” http://www.fool.com/BoringPort/2000/boringport00051501.htm\n\nMunger saw this deterioration before many other people did, mostly likely because Berkshire owned newspaper properties like The Washington Post and The Buffalo News. Berkshire has not given up on all types of newspapers. Papers that cover local news, particularly in a city with a strong sense of community are still attractive for Berkshire even in 2012. They said at the 2012 Berkshire meeting that they may buy more newspapers. These small city newspaper purchases seems to me like a Ben Graham “cigar butt” style investment and for that reason a reversion to an old investing style. But Berkshire have a *lot* of cash to put to work and only so many quality businesses to buy. Too much cash is, as some people say “A high quality problem.” Munger adds: “Excess cash in an advantage, not a disadvantage”. As a pool of investment dollars gets bigger it gets harder to find companies to buy or invest in that have a moat. In this sense size works against investment performance. More than one fund manager has suffered from this problem since the tendency is to ignore the need for a strong moat so you can get large amounts of money put to work.\n\nKodak is a company which once had a strong moat and then began to lose it in dramatic fashion. Munger describes the competitive destruction that hit the photography business:\n\n“What happened to Kodak is a natural outcome of competitive capitalism.” http://www.businessinsider.com/munger-on-buffetts-cancer-the-fed-berkshires-investment-strategy-2012-5#ixzz2CB0ay5jG\n\nIt is true that what happened to Kodak was rough, but the full story according to Munger should take into account that there was a part of Kodak that did have a moat and will survive:\n\n“People think the whole thing failed, but they forget that Kodak didn’t really go broke, because Eastman Chemical did survive as a prosperous company and they spun that off.” http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/22/buffett-munger-berkshire\n\nWhy did Eastman Chemical survive? Most probably Eastman survived due to supply-side economies of scale and intellectual property. Kodak probably has some great patents for chemically-based photography too. But in the case of Kodak and photography the entire process changed to digital and the Kodak moat was swiftly gone.\n\nResearch in Motion losing its Blackberry moat is another example of competitive destruction. Will they recover? The challenge the Blackberry faces is substantial. Once a feedback loop turns negative, it is hard for any company to regain what it once had. What builds you up can tear you down. And if the ride up was nonlinear, it is very possible that the ride down will be nonlinear as well.\n\nAs another example, Munger has said that department stores in downtown areas once had a very strong moat given economies of scale and a central location near mass transit. But then the way people lived started to change as cars became more affordable and people migrated to suburbs with shopping centers. The arrival of Amazon.com has further damaged the moat of the big-box retailers of all kinds whether in the city or the suburbs.\n\nHow Can the Quality of the Moat be Quantified?\n\nThe test of whether you have a moat with a given company is quantitative (i.e., it’s a math-based test). If (1) you are earning profits that are greater than your weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and (2) that level of profitability has maintained for some reasonable period measured in years, you have a strong moat. If the size of the positive difference between ROIC and WACC is large and if that “spread” is persistent over time, your moat is relatively strong. Mauboussin is the one to read on this as is usual. The essay: Measuring the Moat at http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/measuringthemoat.pdf is a classic. Exactly how long the moat must be persistent to meet this test is an interesting question. If it is not a period of at least two years you are taking a significant risk. Five years of supporting data give you more certainty that you moat is sustainable. For a look at this see:\n\nWhat determines whether a business a company has a moat is qualitative (e.g., supply-side and demand-side economies of scale, brand, regulation and intellectual property) but how you test to determine the strength of your moat is quantitative (i.e., it’s a mathematical exercise). Mathematical formulas won’t tell you how to get a moat but they can help prove that you have one, at least for now.\n\nA company like Salesforce.com has not yet passed this quantitative test since management has been running their business at a loss or a tiny profit. Management at Salesforce.com can argue that they are doing this intentionally which seem to be true. But until Salesforce.com proves that it can pass the moat test with evidence that the mathematics satisfy the test, the assertion that the company has a moat is an unproven thesis. In other words, whether Salesforce.com has significant pricing power right now is just a theory. Until GAAP profit margins rise and stay high for a significant period the jury is still out. Any claims that prop0fiost have been earned non-GAAP basis or that the business generated or EBITDA (jokingly referred to by many people as “earnings before everything bad”) should be ignored. On this Munger has said: “I don’t even like to hear the word EBTDA.” He suggests inserting the word “bullshit” whenever you hear the term EBITDA\n\nSpotting the existence of a moat that has not been fully taken advantage of by its current ownership in terms of raising prices can be profitable for an investor buying that business. Warren Buffett points out:\n\n“There are actually businesses, that you will find a few times in a lifetime, where any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising prices — and yet they haven’t done it. So they have huge untapped pricing power that they’re not using. That is the ultimate no-brainer. … Disney found that it could raise those prices a lot and the attendance stayed right up. So a lot of the great record of Eisner and Wells … came from just raising prices at Disneyland and Disneyworld and through video cassette sales of classic animated movies… At Berkshire Hathaway, Warren and I raised the prices of See’s candy a little faster than others might have. And, of course, we invested in Coca-Cola — which had some untapped pricing power. And it also had brilliant management. So a Goizueta and Keough could do much more than raise prices. It was perfect.” http://ycombinator.com/munger.html\n\nStarting with See’s Candies, Munger and Buffett learned that when you have a great moat (in this case driven by a powerful but primarily regional brand), the business can raise prices to improve profitability. On the December 29 of the year that they bought See’s prices were raised 20-30 cents a pound. They also learned that some brands translate less well to new markets and there is a limit on how many stores one can profitably build in a given geographic area.\n\nBuffett has said that Kellogg’s has at times pushed their pricing too far and damaged their moat. Buffet believes that they didn’t have the moat they thought they had versus General Mills and other major breakfast cereal competitors. At a very practical level the discussion above illustrates that there are some rules of thumb one can use to test the strength of a moat. At the top of the list is whether the business has pricing power. For example, if you must hold a prayer meeting before you try to raise prices, then you don’t have much of a moat, if any, argues Buffett. Finally, it should be emphasized that is nothing sinister about the term “moat.” Business is, by its very nature, a competitive process. Even a small restaurant selling barbecue can have a moat. A company that has a return on capital significantly greater than their opportunity cost over time has a moat whether they know it or not. That’s enough about moats for now. The next post will be about Munger’s Investment Filters Two and Three: Circle of Competence and Management with Integrity and Talent.\n\nAt a very practical level the discussion above illustrates that there are some rules of thumb one can use to test the strength of a moat.

While marketing is no substitute for a great product with happy customers or a successful sales motion, nothing can amplify the success of those efforts like good marketing. In the case of a new category, this requires proving that the category actually exists. In the case of an existing category, it requires redefining the category around your disruption. In either case, it takes an active marketing strategy to bring the market around to your point of view.Classic Salesforce ad. Even today, it’s all about category leadership.Define your category.It makes intuitive sense that the startup that defines a new SaaS category will be perceived as the early category leader. It will thus be the beneficiary of investors, talent and customers all seeking to coalesce around an early leader. Conversely, a startup that allows itself to be placed in a category defined by others will be viewed as a late entrant facing tough headwinds.It is therefore imperative that you define your category. This is best done in 2 - 4 clear descriptive words. Avoid flowery language; it needs to be immediately obvious what you do. This is your elevator pitch for an era in which no one has time for an elevator ride anymore. For example, Internal is “No Code Internal Tools”; Product Board is a “Product Management System”; Sendoso is a “Sending Platform” for direct mail, corporate gifts, and customer swag.Forking existing categories around new verticals or platforms is a viable approach. In 1999, Salesforce could differentiate from CRM leader Siebel by introducing the concept of “Cloud CRM.” Today, calling yourself “Cloud CRM” would brand you as a loser to Salesforce, but if for example, you labeled yourself as “CRM for E-commerce,” you could then make the case for why e-commerce deserves its own CRM vertical. The new category should underscore your differentiation.If you can’t define it, redefine it.If you’re not creating a new category, you need to redefine the existing one. Don’t play by other people’s definitions. Yammer adopted this approach a decade ago, when we entered a category led by late-stage startup Jive, who won Gartner’s Magic Quadrant every year for “Social Software in the Workplace.” Gartner excluded Yammer from their quadrant because we lacked certain features on their checklist. By contrast, Jive had been dutifully building for years to meet Gartner’s requirements so their sales reps could take Gartner’s endorsement into Fortune 500 deals. This is how enterprise sales work.If we had been placed in the “Social Software” category, it would have been as a “challenger” or “niche player.” Jive’s sales reps could have used this to undermine us in every deal. Better not to be mentioned at all.Initially upset over our exclusion, we soon counted our blessings. If we had been placed in the “Social Software” category, it would have been as a “challenger” or “niche player.” Jive’s sales reps could have used this to undermine us in every deal. Better not to be mentioned at all. Besides, we weren’t interested in developing Gartner features like wikis and blogs for enterprises. Our product was based on the new paradigm of social networking. Gartner’s category definition looked to us like a hodgepodge of old technologies.We advanced our own category definition, Enterprise Social Networking (ESN), a private secure social network for inside your enterprise. This was more intuitive to almost everyone, and it allowed us to ride the media coattails of what was happening in the consumer space. Freed to define our own product roadmap, we could determine what ESN meant. Our north star was user engagement and bottom-up freemium adoption by employees. On-premise competitors deployed by IT struggled with actual usage and could not compete on these dimensions.Our category definition was validated when Marc Benioff made “The Social Enterprise” the theme of Dreamforce in 2011. Although this introduced a scary new competitor, Salesforce’s Chatter, it cemented our view of the category, helping us brush off old definitions and competitors.Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for “Social Software in the Workplace” when Yammer entered the market. This was a crowded category so we redefined it.Categories are how business understands problems.Business understands problems by categorizing them, so convincing the world that a new category is valid is tantamount to winning. For example, let’s say you’re a SaaS company creating tools for product managers. Your argument would go something like this: “Every other team in the company has its own system: Sales has CRM (Salesforce), the Finance team has ERP (Netsuite), Customer Support has CS Ticketing (Zendesk). But Product has been ignored. Product Managers need their own software — a Product Management System. In fact, every company needs a PMS or it will be shortchanging their product managers and ultimately their product.” Then, every time you announce a new customer or revenue milestone or a new fundraise or a product release, you will cite it as evidence that PMS is a major new category of business software. As the world buys into this framing and the category takes hold, the sale will switch from an evangelical sale (which is hard and handcrafted) to order-taking (which is easier and repeatable). If you are the definer, it’s likely you will be the one taking most of the orders.As the category takes hold, the sale will switch from an evangelical sale (which is hard and handcrafted) to order-taking (which is easier and repeatable).Use customer testimony to prove the category.Your most powerful weapon in proving out a category is customer testimony. Prospects will naturally be suspicious of any claims you make. Your message is most credible coming from others, especially customers who can testify to their first-hand success with the product. Benioff explains this in his book Behind the Cloud (in particular, see Chapter 3 on marketing). One of Salesforce’s most successful ad campaigns showed photos of CEOs with pull quotes about how Salesforce had helped their business become more successful. Benioff was never featured; it was all about the customers. Make sure you get logos, press releases, case studies, and reference accounts, which all serve to reinforce your market leadership.Shape the category requirements to position yourself and de-position competitors.Once you’ve defined the category, you can flesh out the category requirements. This is the time to talk about features. You can position yourself and de-position competitors by explaining what functionality is critical for a product of this type.Yammer’s competitor Jive was run by top enterprise sales executives and was excellent at this. We always knew we were in a bake-off with Jive when the prospect asked us about analytics. Jive had just rolled out an analytics package. Their argument was “if you can’t measure it, it doesn’t have value.” A pretty compelling argument. So we raced to release a good-enough analytics feature and responded, “of course you need to be able to measure it — and we have that — but what you’re really trying to measure is employee engagement. Yammer is the only one that employees adopt on their own.” And so on it went, both sides looking for their next trump card.In the end, the deciding factor in our competition was architectural. Yammer was born in the cloud whereas Jive was on-premise. Eventually our viral freemium model swamped them, in both leads and popularity. If you can position yourself around an architectural strength and de-position your competitor around an architectural weakness, it will be very hard for them to respond. Architecture is destiny.If you can position yourself around an architectural strength and de-position your competitor around an architectural weakness, it will be very hard for them to respond.Pick noble fights but keep it positive.Going up against a large legacy incumbent is common when you’re redefining a category. It’s fine to draw sharp contrasts — and even pick fights — as long as you punch up not down, stay product-focused, and keep the tone positive. In the early days of Salesforce’s ascent, Benioff obviously drew pleasure from ridiculing Oracle’s cost and complexity. When Oracle introduced its “private cloud,” an expensive on-premise database, Benioff mocked it by showing a picture of the massive piece of hardware under the headline “Beware the fake cloud.” Lighthearted mocking of an incumbent’s legacy product is the best tone.When big companies enter your category, treat it as validation.Eventually, if you’re successful, big companies will stop seeking to discredit your disruption and seek to copy it. When that happens, do not react with spite; welcome them to the category. It’s validation of everything you’ve been saying for years. Elon’s reaction to Ford’s announcement of a new electric SUV, suspiciously timed to step on his unveiling of the Cybertruck, was a perfect example of this. He congratulated Ford and cited it as progress in moving the world to electric vehicles.When incumbents adopt your category definition, when they define their agenda to respond to you, instead of your needing to respond to them, don’t sweat it — it means you’re the new category leader.\n\nIt’s not just VCs who want to back the category leader — it’s customers too.

It discusses the benefits of being a category leader, such as attracting more funding and customers, and outlines strategies for defining or redefining a category, using customer testimony to prove the category, and positioning the startup against competitors.\n\nKey Insights:\n- Early category leadership is crucial for SaaS startups as it attracts more funding and customers. Over 75% of the market cap in a software category typically goes to the category leader.\n- Startups should define their category in clear, descriptive words. If they're not creating a new category, they should redefine the existing one to avoid being seen as a late entrant.\n- Customer testimony is a powerful tool in proving a category. It provides credibility to the startup's claims and reinforces market leadership.\n- Once a category is defined, startups can flesh out the category requirements to position themselves and de-position competitors.

That's it -- no wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the device, no support for Ogg -- nothing but the essentials, well executed. We took a similar approach when launching Gmail. It was fast, stored all of your email (back when 4MB quotas were the norm), and had an innovative interface based on conversations and search.

By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product.

My iPhone is ready to use in under 1/2 second, while my laptop always takes at least a few seconds to wake up, and then there's a bunch of stuff going on that distracts me. The iPhone is a simple appliance that I use without a second thought, but my laptop feels like a complex machine that causes me to pause and consider if it's worth the effort right now. The downside of the iPhone is that it's small and slow (though the smallness is certainly a feature as well).

    "ai_summary": "Summary:\nThe article by Paul Buchheit discusses the common misconception that a successful product must have more features. Instead, he argues that a great product focuses on a few key attributes that are executed exceptionally well. He uses the iPod and Gmail as examples of products that were successful because they focused on a few core features rather than trying to do everything.\n\nKey Insights:\n- The mindset that \"more features = better\" is a common misjudgment in product design. This leads to unsuccessful products that try to do too much.\n- The right approach to new products is to pick three key attributes or features, execute them exceptionally well, and forget about everything else. These attributes define the product's essence and value.\n- Secondary and tertiary features can be added or improved later on, but if the basic product isn't compelling, adding more features won't save it.\n- The real value of a device lies in the new things that people do once they have a fast, simple, and sharable internet window sitting around.\n- This advice is more applicable to consumer products where the purchaser is also the user. For markets with long lists of feature requirements, it might be necessary to have more features.\n\nMain Takeaways:\n- When designing a product, focus on a few key features and execute them exceptionally well. Don't get distracted by trying to add too many features.\n- Make sure the basic product is compelling before adding or improving secondary and tertiary features.\n- Understand the essence and value of your product. If it needs \"everything\" to be good, it's probably not very innovative.",

It highlights that many successful companies like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox were not the first in their respective markets, but succeeded due to superior products or unique approaches.\n\n2. Key Insights:\n- Many successful companies have entered markets that were perceived as crowded, but they managed to succeed by offering superior products or services.\n- A market that seems crowded can actually be quite empty if no one is providing a high-quality product or service.\n- Companies that seem to be doing well in a crowded market may only be gaining traction because the market needs a product similar to what they offer, not because their product is particularly good.\n- Just because a product or service has been tried before doesn't mean a new entrant can't succeed.\n- The success of a new entrant in a crowded market depends on factors such as the quality of leadership, the strength of the product and brand, and the company's distribution capabilities.\n\n3. Main Takeaways:\n- Don't be deterred from entering a market just because it appears crowded. Instead, assess the quality of the existing products or services and identify opportunities for improvement.\n- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors, including their leadership, product quality, brand strength, and distribution capabilities.\n- Remember that success in a crowded market often comes from offering a superior product or service, or a unique approach that differentiates you from the competition.",

Just look at what Instagram Stories is doing to Snap, surpassing it recently even among its dedicated teen demographic. Does all this mean that network effects as we know them are dead? No, but they’re more dynamic than ever. While we know that not all network effects are created equal, they don’t evolve equally either. Every product has different types of network effects that mature and develop differently over time. If anything, most network effects businesses are changing faster than ever before. So how can entrepreneurs and founders navigate this era of seemingly diminishing network effects? The trick is to know what your network effects look like today, but also project how they’ll evolve over time. To that end, you’ll need to understand three aspects of your company and how they could change going forward: 1) your value proposition, 2) your users/inventory, and 3) your competitive ecosystem. Otherwise you could get caught flat-footed, claiming that network effects are dead. Here’s some principles for forecasting future network effects beyond a present-day, static view. Then, once you know you have network effects, see this post for how to measure and keep them. 1) Value prop: Not all products are created equal A company’s or product’s network effects don’t always remain on an increasing-returns (or even straight) line trajectory as it grows; it could asymptote, or hit an inflection point and even reverse. The key for founders is to know what value proposition drives their network effects, understand whether they’re weak or strong, and then pay close attention to how they will evolve — especially as you iterate your way to new value propositions and additional layers of product-market fit. Let’s take a look at a few examples: Ridesharing. Within any geography, driver supply and passenger demand reinforce each other, so more drivers mean lower wait times, which means more passenger demand, which means more drivers want to drive… the flywheel spins! But there’s a hitch to that value proposition: Once you hit the 5-minute wait time in a particular geography, riders are indifferent to whether there are more drivers available in the network. And once multiple platforms hit that level of relative liquidity (e.g., enough drivers to satisfy the riders 5-minute wait time), the specific platform matters less to riders. In those markets, they’ll need to compete on other vectors, like brand/reputation, price, user experience, loyalty programs, and more. In other words, the value proposition needs to evolve. Social lending. Sometimes changes in network effects are driven not by relative liquidity (like wait times), but by absolute liquidity (like the number of people in a network). Take the case study of Frank, which let people borrow money from and lend money to friends and family [full disclosure: one of us co-founded Frank]. Early on, more friends in Frank groups meant more demand and more liquidity, which created a bigger incentive for people to join those groups. But once a group had more than 7 people, they became less likely to lend or borrow: turns out people only have ~7 friends/family members they have that level of trust with! The network effects in this case went from positive to negative as an individual’s network outgrew the value proposition. This pattern has also held true for a number of other highly social products. Social networks. As Facebook’s use case went from sharing status updates with friends to surfacing news and content, the network effects weakened. Too many friends/followers meant people didn’t feel as comfortable sharing personal content, and the experience shifted more to news and public content. The value proposition and network effects shifted accordingly — from social networking to social media. Importantly, adding additional nodes in the context of media discovery was less valuable than it was in the earlier days of a pure social network. So the shift in value proposition meant the network effect curve hit an inflection point. And while some features (e.g. curation algorithms, timelines) helped defer this tipping point by letting users add more friends while still letting the content feel relevant, eventually the content mix, the value proposition, and the network effects all shifted. Decentralized platforms. If one thinks of bitcoin, for instance, as digital gold, then the network effect would be that more buyers/sellers mean more liquidity which increases the value of the platform for all. But if one thinks of bitcoin as a payments platform, then more is not necessarily better as long as it experiences network congestion or other friction. It’s an interesting case to consider (not for investment purposes), simply because it’s an example of how different value propositions for the same platform can strengthen or weaken network effects accordingly. It’s also a great example of how additional features (e.g., scaling, increased throughput, and improved transaction speeds) can help the value proposition evolve, shift, or even create a new trajectory of network effects. The goal of sharing the above examples is to show both the nuances and evolution of network effects. If you’re not paying attention to these factors, you could be left believing that network effects just don’t exist anymore in a particular business, when it might be a matter of unlocking new value. 2) Users and Inventory: Not all users are created equal The type of users and inventory your product or platform has today, and the types you’re adding, are fundamental in understanding and projecting the trajectory of your network effects. Commoditized vs. differentiated supply An important factor in projecting network effects — especially in two-sided platforms/marketplaces — is whether users/inventory are commoditized or differentiated. In ridesharing, the customer (rider) is relatively agnostic to the underlying service provider/inventory because they perceive the supply (drivers/cars/transport) as interchangeable and therefore commoditized. Platforms with relatively commoditized inventory — from on-demand storage companies to delivery companies — are more likely to see their network effects asymptote once they reach a base level of liquidity. For a category like ridesharing, moving into adjacent businesses (like Lyft has done with their healthcare initiative or Uber has done with food delivery) allows differentiated — yet still substitutable — inventory, potentially increasing the strength of the network effect. Platforms/marketplaces with more differentiated inventory have stronger and longer-lasting network effects, because they have a diversity of inventory that suits the unique preferences of customers (while maintaining just-enough substitutability across that inventory as well). For example, AirBnB can show users every iteration of lodging from $225-$325/night in Los Angeles, which overlaps with someone else’s search for something that costs $150-$250 and has a both a balcony and a hot tub. The platform is therefore more valuable on both sides of the marketplace than a site that just shows a commoditized set of standard and executive rooms. The network effects remain strong not only because it reaches a base level of liquidity across all these different types of inventory (making them valuable to more users), but because it also continues to see increasing returns with new supply. But the more differentiated the inventory, the more the platform needs to do a good job of curation and matching. That in and of itself also increases the overall defensibility of the platform, and keeps the network effects curve strong over time. Type of incremental user Beyond the commoditized nature of users and inventory, however, not all members of a given network are equal. Some are more — or less — valuable than others. For instance, a restaurant that is very popular and located nearby a lot of users adds more value to the OpenTable network than a restaurant with bad food in the middle of nowhere. When you forecast out your network effects — and more importantly, your growth strategy for acquiring and engaging more users — you will need to pay attention to the incremental users you’re likely to attract. Are they network “contaminants”, “neutrals”, or “contributors”? For a social network, adding a troll that disengages other users is a pollutant who removes value. Adding a lurker is neutral since that person doesn’t add or subtract any value from the network. Adding a great content producer contributes an enormous amount of value to the network. So, making sure to incent the users you want while disincenting the ones you don’t want, is key. This is why most great platforms also invest heavily in curation mechanisms to screen and remove bad inventory/users (e.g., Wikipedia’s editors, Airbnb’s reviews/onboarding, etc.). Unfortunately, these screening mechanisms don’t always work and sometimes the cost of finding strong contributors becomes very high, so the calculus of growth relative to cost matters a lot here. 3) The Competition: Not all markets are created equal The nature of your market as well as competitors and substitutes is also critically important to understanding and forecasting network effects. Network overlap While network effects businesses tend to be more defensible at scale, they are not immune to competition. But for these types of businesses it’s not just a matter of figuring out who your direct competitors are — you also need to think about the network overlap. If someone else has a similar network to yours, there’s always existential risk they’ll move into your market. Because they have a similar network already, they’ll more easily be able to enter your space (Instagram’s foray into Snapchat-like disposable “Stories” is a good example of this). This is also true where the competition may already have registered a superset of your network (e.g., DoorDash and Uber Eats; Didi and Uber in China). Switching costs Low switching costs to competitors can also lower network effects. Seamless sign-up and onboarding is usually great for adding users to your product, but if your competitors have that same seamless onboarding, users might multi-tenant. It’s easy to use multiple dating apps or maps products because of low barriers to entry and switching costs. Multi-tenanting to meet demand Network effects are weakened when users are unable to use a single platform to accomplish their goals. Jobs marketplaces are a good example here: companies are likely to list their job openings on multiple hiring platforms (i.e., multi-tenant), since hiring is a critical part of running a business that absolutely needs to be fully fulfilled, and no single platform is likely to fulfill all of their hiring needs. Where one side of a platform is multi-tenanting, there will usually be increased pressure on the operator — in terms of pricing, features, and necessary liquidity — which can turn the economics upside down. We go into detail on how to measure all of these in our other post, 16 metrics for measuring network effects: https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/. * * * Fast followers can move faster than ever. Instagram Stories can challenge Snap in, well, a snap. Hiring marketplaces can get thousands of employers in no time. The API-ization of everything makes it easier to do anything and everything: Stripe alone means that every marketplace can incorporate payments in an hour, whereas previously, eBay had some protection by building and acquiring its own payment systems. The increasing speed of product iteration, the pace at which networks can scale, and the ease with which competitors can get started has therefore dramatically changed how we project network effects in businesses. Instead of winner-take-all markets where early movers may have once had a seemingly lasting advantage, network effects change more quickly than ever. Especially where specific factors — an asymptotic value proposition, network overlap, increasing number of contaminants, etc. — can lower the platform’s ability to generate a sustainable network effect in the future. This is not to depress anyone! Network effects will continue to underpin the most impactful software businesses. It’s merely a reminder to founders and other product builders to be aware of what will change and why, so you can do more to plan and address these issues instead of being blindsided by them. Network effects aren’t dead, but they’re more dynamic than ever. By understanding what your network effects look like today and where they’re going tomorrow, founders can design network effects and other moats with intentionality, instead of being tossed on the winds of change.

Furthermore, even companies that appear to have initially won the market and seem to have established a deep moat — from dating apps to trading platforms — are struggling to maintain their position against copycats and new entrants. Just look at what Instagram Stories is doing to Snap, surpassing it recently even among its dedicated teen demographic.\n\nDoes all this mean that network effects as we know them are dead? No, but they’re more dynamic than ever.\n\nWhile we know that not all network effects are created equal, they don’t evolve equally either. Every product has different types of network effects that mature and develop differently over time. If anything, most network effects businesses are changing faster than ever before. So how can entrepreneurs and founders navigate this era of seemingly diminishing network effects? The trick is to know what your network effects look like today, but also project how they’ll evolve over time. To that end, you’ll need to understand three aspects of your company and how they could change going forward: 1) your value proposition, 2) your users/inventory, and 3) your competitive ecosystem. Otherwise you could get caught flat-footed, claiming that network effects are dead.\n\nHere’s some principles for forecasting future network effects beyond a present-day, static view. Then, once you know you have network effects, see this post for how to measure and keep them.\n\n1) Value prop: Not all products are created equal\n\nA company’s or product’s network effects don’t always remain on an increasing-returns (or even straight) line trajectory as it grows; it could asymptote, or hit an inflection point and even reverse. The key for founders is to know what value proposition drives their network effects, understand whether they’re weak or strong, and then pay close attention to how they will evolve — especially as you iterate your way to new value propositions and additional layers of product-market fit.\n\nLet’s take a look at a few examples:\n\nRidesharing. Within any geography, driver supply and passenger demand reinforce each other, so more drivers mean lower wait times, which means more passenger demand, which means more drivers want to drive… the flywheel spins! But there’s a hitch to that value proposition: Once you hit the 5-minute wait time in a particular geography, riders are indifferent to whether there are more drivers available in the network. And once multiple platforms hit that level of relative liquidity (e.g., enough drivers to satisfy the riders 5-minute wait time), the specific platform matters less to riders. In those markets, they’ll need to compete on other vectors, like brand/reputation, price, user experience, loyalty programs, and more. In other words, the value proposition needs to evolve.\n\nSocial lending. Sometimes changes in network effects are driven not by relative liquidity (like wait times), but by absolute liquidity (like the number of people in a network). Take the case study of Frank, which let people borrow money from and lend money to friends and family [full disclosure: one of us co-founded Frank]. Early on, more friends in Frank groups meant more demand and more liquidity, which created a bigger incentive for people to join those groups. But once a group had more than 7 people, they became less likely to lend or borrow: turns out people only have ~7 friends/family members they have that level of trust with! The network effects in this case went from positive to negative as an individual’s network outgrew the value proposition. This pattern has also held true for a number of other highly social products.\n\nSocial networks. As Facebook’s use case went from sharing status updates with friends to surfacing news and content, the network effects weakened. Too many friends/followers meant people didn’t feel as comfortable sharing personal content, and the experience shifted more to news and public content. The value proposition and network effects shifted accordingly — from social networking to social media. Importantly, adding additional nodes in the context of media discovery was less valuable than it was in the earlier days of a pure social network. So the shift in value proposition meant the network effect curve hit an inflection point. And while some features (e.g. curation algorithms, timelines) helped defer this tipping point by letting users add more friends while still letting the content feel relevant, eventually the content mix, the value proposition, and the network effects all shifted.\n\nDecentralized platforms. If one thinks of bitcoin, for instance, as digital gold, then the network effect would be that more buyers/sellers mean more liquidity which increases the value of the platform for all. But if one thinks of bitcoin as a payments platform, then more is not necessarily better as long as it experiences network congestion or other friction. It’s an interesting case to consider (not for investment purposes), simply because it’s an example of how different value propositions for the same platform can strengthen or weaken network effects accordingly. It’s also a great example of how additional features (e.g., scaling, increased throughput, and improved transaction speeds) can help the value proposition evolve, shift, or even create a new trajectory of network effects.\n\nThe goal of sharing the above examples is to show both the nuances and evolution of network effects. If you’re not paying attention to these factors, you could be left believing that network effects just don’t exist anymore in a particular business, when it might be a matter of unlocking new value.\n\n2) Users and Inventory: Not all users are created equal\n\nThe type of users and inventory your product or platform has today, and the types you’re adding, are fundamental in understanding and projecting the trajectory of your network effects.\n\nCommoditized vs. differentiated supply\n\nAn important factor in projecting network effects — especially in two-sided platforms/marketplaces — is whether users/inventory are commoditized or differentiated.\n\nIn ridesharing, the customer (rider) is relatively agnostic to the underlying service provider/inventory because they perceive the supply (drivers/cars/transport) as interchangeable and therefore commoditized. Platforms with relatively commoditized inventory — from on-demand storage companies to delivery companies — are more likely to see their network effects asymptote once they reach a base level of liquidity. For a category like ridesharing, moving into adjacent businesses (like Lyft has done with their healthcare initiative or Uber has done with food delivery) allows differentiated — yet still substitutable — inventory, potentially increasing the strength of the network effect.\n\nPlatforms/marketplaces with more differentiated inventory have stronger and longer-lasting network effects, because they have a diversity of inventory that suits the unique preferences of customers (while maintaining just-enough substitutability across that inventory as well). For example, AirBnB can show users every iteration of lodging from $225-$325/night in Los Angeles, which overlaps with someone else’s search for something that costs $150-$250 and has a both a balcony and a hot tub. The platform is therefore more valuable on both sides of the marketplace than a site that just shows a commoditized set of standard and executive rooms. The network effects remain strong not only because it reaches a base level of liquidity across all these different types of inventory (making them valuable to more users), but because it also continues to see increasing returns with new supply.\n\nBut the more differentiated the inventory, the more the platform needs to do a good job of curation and matching. That in and of itself also increases the overall defensibility of the platform, and keeps the network effects curve strong over time.\n\nType of incremental user\n\nBeyond the commoditized nature of users and inventory, however, not all members of a given network are equal. Some are more — or less — valuable than others. For instance, a restaurant that is very popular and located nearby a lot of users adds more value to the OpenTable network than a restaurant with bad food in the middle of nowhere.\n\nWhen you forecast out your network effects — and more importantly, your growth strategy for acquiring and engaging more users — you will need to pay attention to the incremental users you’re likely to attract. Are they network “contaminants”, “neutrals”, or “contributors”? For a social network, adding a troll that disengages other users is a pollutant who removes value. Adding a lurker is neutral since that person doesn’t add or subtract any value from the network. Adding a great content producer contributes an enormous amount of value to the network.\n\nSo, making sure to incent the users you want while disincenting the ones you don’t want, is key. This is why most great platforms also invest heavily in curation mechanisms to screen and remove bad inventory/users (e.g., Wikipedia’s editors, Airbnb’s reviews/onboarding, etc.). Unfortunately, these screening mechanisms don’t always work and sometimes the cost of finding strong contributors becomes very high, so the calculus of growth relative to cost matters a lot here.\n\n3) The Competition: Not all markets are created equal\n\nThe nature of your market as well as competitors and substitutes is also critically important to understanding and forecasting network effects.\n\nNetwork overlap\n\nWhile network effects businesses tend to be more defensible at scale, they are not immune to competition. But for these types of businesses it’s not just a matter of figuring out who your direct competitors are — you also need to think about the network overlap. If someone else has a similar network to yours, there’s always existential risk they’ll move into your market. Because they have a similar network already, they’ll more easily be able to enter your space (Instagram’s foray into Snapchat-like disposable “Stories” is a good example of this). This is also true where the competition may already have registered a superset of your network (e.g., DoorDash and Uber Eats; Didi and Uber in China).\n\nSwitching costs\n\nLow switching costs to competitors can also lower network effects. Seamless sign-up and onboarding is usually great for adding users to your product, but if your competitors have that same seamless onboarding, users might multi-tenant. It’s easy to use multiple dating apps or maps products because of low barriers to entry and switching costs.\n\nMulti-tenanting to meet demand\n\nNetwork effects are weakened when users are unable to use a single platform to accomplish their goals. Jobs marketplaces are a good example here: companies are likely to list their job openings on multiple hiring platforms (i.e., multi-tenant), since hiring is a critical part of running a business that absolutely needs to be fully fulfilled, and no single platform is likely to fulfill all of their hiring needs. Where one side of a platform is multi-tenanting, there will usually be increased pressure on the operator — in terms of pricing, features, and necessary liquidity — which can turn the economics upside down.\n\nWe go into detail on how to measure all of these in our other post, 16 metrics for measuring network effects: https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/.\n\nFast followers can move faster than ever. Instagram Stories can challenge Snap in, well, a snap. Hiring marketplaces can get thousands of employers in no time. The API-ization of everything makes it easier to do anything and everything: Stripe alone means that every marketplace can incorporate payments in an hour, whereas previously, eBay had some protection by building and acquiring its own payment systems.\n\nThe increasing speed of product iteration, the pace at which networks can scale, and the ease with which competitors can get started has therefore dramatically changed how we project network effects in businesses. Instead of winner-take-all markets where early movers may have once had a seemingly lasting advantage, network effects change more quickly than ever. Especially where specific factors — an asymptotic value proposition, network overlap, increasing number of contaminants, etc. — can lower the platform’s ability to generate a sustainable network effect in the future.\n\nThis is not to depress anyone! Network effects will continue to underpin the most impactful software businesses. It’s merely a reminder to founders and other product builders to be aware of what will change and why, so you can do more to plan and address these issues instead of being blindsided by them. Network effects aren’t dead, but they’re more dynamic than ever. By understanding what your network effects look like today and where they’re going tomorrow, founders can design network effects and other moats with intentionality, instead of being tossed on the winds of change.\n\nLong live your network effects!\n\nContributors D'Arcy Coolican D'Arcy Coolican is a partner on the investment team where he focuses on marketplaces, social networks, and consumer technology companies.

It argues that while network effects are not dead, they are more dynamic than ever, with companies needing to understand their current network effects and how they might evolve. The authors suggest that businesses need to consider three aspects: their value proposition, their users/inventory, and their competitive ecosystem.\n\nKey Insights:\n- Network effects are not static and evolve over time, with different products having different types of network effects that mature and develop differently.\n- The value proposition of a company or product can affect the strength and trajectory of its network effects. For example, once a ridesharing service achieves a 5-minute wait time, adding more drivers doesn't necessarily add more value.\n- The type of users and inventory a platform has can influence the trajectory of its network effects. Commoditized users/inventory can cause network effects to plateau, while differentiated users/inventory can strengthen and prolong network effects.\n- The nature of the market and competition can also impact network effects. For example, low switching costs can weaken network effects, while network overlap can pose an existential risk.\n\nMain Takeaways:\n- Companies need to understand their current network effects and how they might evolve over time, considering their value proposition, users/inventory, and competitive ecosystem.\n- Businesses should pay attention to the value proposition that drives their network effects and how it might evolve, especially as they develop new value propositions and layers of product-market fit.\n- Companies should consider the type of users and inventory they have and are adding, as well as the nature of their market and competition, when projecting the trajectory of their network effects.",

In the x-axis you can see how many customers you need, for a given ARPA, to get to $100 million in annual revenues. Both axes use a logarithmic scale. To build a Web company with $100 million in annual revenues*, you essentially need: 1,000 enterprise customers paying you $100k+ per year each; or 10,000 medium-sized companies paying you $10k+ per year each; or 100,000 small businesses paying you $1k+ per year each; or 1 million consumers or \"prosumers\" paying you $100+ per year each (or, in the case of eCommerce businesses, 1M customers generating $100+ in contribution margin** per year each); or 10 million active consumers who you monetize at $10+ per year each by selling ads Salespeople sometimes refer to \"elephants\", \"deers\" and \"rabbits\" when they talk about the first three categories of customers. To extend the metaphor to the 4th and 5th type of customer, let's call them \"mice\" and \"flies\". So how can you hunt 1,000 elephants, 10,000 deers, 100,000 rabbits, 1,000,000 mice or 10,000,000 flies? Let's take a look at it in reverse order. Hunting flies In order to get to 10 million active users you need roughly 100 million people who download your app or use your website. This is of course a gross simplification, and the precise number depends on various factors like your conversion rate, how active your users are, churn, etc. But it doesn't change the take-away: To get to $100 million in ad revenues, you need dozens of millions of users. I know of only two ways to achieve that (plus one mega-outlier which breaks all rules, Google). The first one is to have a product that is inherently social and has a high viral coefficient (Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp). The second one is a ton of UGC (user-generated content), which leads to large amounts of SEO traffic and some level of virality. Good examples of this second option include Yelp or our portfolio company Brainly. Hunting mice To acquire one million consumers or prosumers who pay you roughly $100 per year, you need to get at least 10-20 million people to try your application. This is - again - a gross simplification, but I believe it's order-of-magnitude correct. To get to 10-20 million users you almost certainly need some level of virality, too - maybe not Snapchat-like virality, but some social sharing or \"powered by\"-virality. Great examples of this category include Evernote and MailChimp. If you're an eCommerce business you might be able to acquire one million customers using paid marketing, but it requires huge amounts of funding. Hunting rabbits Most SaaS companies that target small businesses charge something around $50-100 per month, so their ARPA per year is around $1k. To acquire 100,000 of these businesses you need something in the order of 0.5-2 million trial signups, depending on your conversion rate. Let's assume that your CLTV (customer lifetime value) is $2,700 (assuming an average customer lifetime of three years and a gross margin of 90%) and that you want your CLTV to be 4x your CACs (customer acquisition costs). In that case you can spend $675 to acquire a customer. If your signup-to-paying conversion rate is 10% that means you can spend $67.50 per signup (assuming a no-touch sales model where your CACs can go entirely into lead generation). So how can you get one million signups for less than $70 each? Most SaaS products aren't inherently viral, there usually isn't enough inventory to make paid advertising work at scale, and cold calling usually doesn't work at this ARPA level. There's no silver bullet, but the closest thing to a silver bullet is inbound marketing - besides having a fantastic product with a very high NPS (net promoter score) and being obsessively focused on funnel optimization. I've written about this in more detail in my \"DOs for SaaS startups\" series: Create an awesome product, Make your website your best marketing person, Fill the funnel, Build a repeatable sales process. Another option is a an OEM strategy (i.e. getting your product distributed by big partners), which can work but comes with its own challenges. Interestingly, hunting rabbits looks much less straightforward than hunting flies or hunting elephants. Why we have a strong focus on rabbit hunting SaaS companies nonetheless is something for another post. Hunting deers If you're a deer hunter and want to acquire 10,000 customers paying you $10k per year each, most of the rabbit hunting tactics still apply. An ARPA of $10k per year usually isn't enough to make traditional enterprise field sales work, and you likely still have to get 100,000 or more leads. The main difference is that when you're hunting deers you can use an inside sales force to close leads, potentially also to generate leads. It also means that you can pay VARs and channel partners an attractive commission, although I've rarely seen this work in SaaS. SaaS companies sometimes start as rabbit hunters and expand into deer hunting over time. This can work very well and we're very excited about these types of businesses, but to successfully execute this strategy, SaaS founders with a product/tech/marketing DNA usually have to bring in an experienced VP of Sales who has built an inside sales organization before. Hunting elephants Like it or not, most of the biggest SaaS companies derive most of their revenues from selling expensive subscriptions to large enterprises. Workday, Veeva, SuccessFactors, Salesforce.com, you name it. Jason M. Lemkin, another friend and co-investor, once said (I'm quoting from memory) that if you have a good solution for a significant problem experienced by large enterprises, building a $100 million business is relatively straightforward. After all, you only need 1,000 customers, and the $100k you need from each of them is less than they spend on the salary of one executive. I think there's a lot of truth in that. The other part of the truth, though, is that it may take you several years and millions of dollars to find out if you really are solving a problem (a.k.a. product/market fit), and once you're at that point, you still need tens of millions of dollars or more to finance the enterprise sales cycle.

I'd like to expand on the topic and suggest that there are five ways to build a $100 million Internet company. This doesn't mean that I disagree with Boris' article. I think our views are pretty similar, and for the most part \"my\" five ways are just a slightly different and more granular look at Boris' two ways. The way I look at it can be nicely illustrated in this way: The y-axis shows the average revenue per account (ARPA) per year. In the x-axis you can see how many customers you need, for a given ARPA, to get to $100 million in annual revenues. Both axes use a logarithmic scale. To build a Web company with $100 million in annual revenues*, you essentially need: 1,000 enterprise customers paying you $100k+ per year each; or 10,000 medium-sized companies paying you $10k+ per year each; or 100,000 small businesses paying you $1k+ per year each; or 1 million consumers or \"prosumers\" paying you $100+ per year each (or, in the case of eCommerce businesses, 1M customers generating $100+ in contribution margin** per year each); or 10 million active consumers who you monetize at $10+ per year each by selling ads Salespeople sometimes refer to \"elephants\", \"deers\" and \"rabbits\" when they talk about the first three categories of customers. To extend the metaphor to the 4th and 5th type of customer, let's call them \"mice\" and \"flies\". So how can you hunt 1,000 elephants, 10,000 deers, 100,000 rabbits, 1,000,000 mice or 10,000,000 flies? Let's take a look at it in reverse order. Hunting flies In order to get to 10 million active users you need roughly 100 million people who download your app or use your website. This is of course a gross simplification, and the precise number depends on various factors like your conversion rate, how active your users are, churn, etc. But it doesn't change the take-away: To get to $100 million in ad revenues, you need dozens of millions of users. I know of only two ways to achieve that (plus one mega-outlier which breaks all rules, Google). The first one is to have a product that is inherently social and has a high viral coefficient (Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp). The second one is a ton of UGC (user-generated content), which leads to large amounts of SEO traffic and some level of virality. Good examples of this second option include Yelp or our portfolio company Brainly. Hunting mice To acquire one million consumers or prosumers who pay you roughly $100 per year, you need to get at least 10-20 million people to try your application. This is - again - a gross simplification, but I believe it's order-of-magnitude correct. To get to 10-20 million users you almost certainly need some level of virality, too - maybe not Snapchat-like virality, but some social sharing or \"powered by\"-virality. Great examples of this category include Evernote and MailChimp. If you're an eCommerce business you might be able to acquire one million customers using paid marketing, but it requires huge amounts of funding. Hunting rabbits Most SaaS companies that target small businesses charge something around $50-100 per month, so their ARPA per year is around $1k. To acquire 100,000 of these businesses you need something in the order of 0.5-2 million trial signups, depending on your conversion rate. Let's assume that your CLTV (customer lifetime value) is $2,700 (assuming an average customer lifetime of three years and a gross margin of 90%) and that you want your CLTV to be 4x your CACs (customer acquisition costs). In that case you can spend $675 to acquire a customer. If your signup-to-paying conversion rate is 10% that means you can spend $67.50 per signup (assuming a no-touch sales model where your CACs can go entirely into lead generation). So how can you get one million signups for less than $70 each? Most SaaS products aren't inherently viral, there usually isn't enough inventory to make paid advertising work at scale, and cold calling usually doesn't work at this ARPA level. There's no silver bullet, but the closest thing to a silver bullet is inbound marketing - besides having a fantastic product with a very high NPS (net promoter score) and being obsessively focused on funnel optimization. I've written about this in more detail in my \"DOs for SaaS startups\" series: Create an awesome product, Make your website your best marketing person, Fill the funnel, Build a repeatable sales process. Another option is a an OEM strategy (i.e. getting your product distributed by big partners), which can work but comes with its own challenges. Interestingly, hunting rabbits looks much less straightforward than hunting flies or hunting elephants. Why we have a strong focus on rabbit hunting SaaS companies nonetheless is something for another post. Hunting deers If you're a deer hunter and want to acquire 10,000 customers paying you $10k per year each, most of the rabbit hunting tactics still apply. An ARPA of $10k per year usually isn't enough to make traditional enterprise field sales work, and you likely still have to get 100,000 or more leads. The main difference is that when you're hunting deers you can use an inside sales force to close leads, potentially also to generate leads. It also means that you can pay VARs and channel partners an attractive commission, although I've rarely seen this work in SaaS. SaaS companies sometimes start as rabbit hunters and expand into deer hunting over time. This can work very well and we're very excited about these types of businesses, but to successfully execute this strategy, SaaS founders with a product/tech/marketing DNA usually have to bring in an experienced VP of Sales who has built an inside sales organization before. Hunting elephants Like it or not, most of the biggest SaaS companies derive most of their revenues from selling expensive subscriptions to large enterprises. Workday, Veeva, SuccessFactors, Salesforce.com, you name it. Jason M. Lemkin, another friend and co-investor, once said (I'm quoting from memory) that if you have a good solution for a significant problem experienced by large enterprises, building a $100 million business is relatively straightforward. After all, you only need 1,000 customers, and the $100k you need from each of them is less than they spend on the salary of one executive. I think there's a lot of truth in that. The other part of the truth, though, is that it may take you several years and millions of dollars to find out if you really are solving a problem (a.k.a. product/market fit), and once you're at that point, you still need tens of millions of dollars or more to finance the enterprise sales cycle. This does not at all mean that elephant hunting isn't attractive. It just requires very different skills, which usually means a founder team with enterprise sales DNA.

    "ai_summary": "Summary:\nThe article by Christoph Janz outlines five strategies to build a $100 million internet company. These strategies are based on the type of customers targeted, ranging from large enterprises to individual consumers. The author uses the metaphor of hunting different animals (elephants, deers, rabbits, mice, flies) to represent the different customer categories and discusses the unique approaches required for each.\n\nKey Insights:\n- To build a $100 million internet company, one needs to target either: 1,000 enterprise customers paying $100k+ per year each; 10,000 medium-sized companies paying $10k+ per year each; 100,000 small businesses paying $1k+ per year each; 1 million consumers or \"prosumers\" paying $100+ per year each; or 10 million active consumers monetized at $10+ per year each by selling ads.\n- The author uses the metaphor of hunting different animals to represent the different customer categories: elephants (enterprise customers), deers (medium-sized companies), rabbits (small businesses), mice (consumers or prosumers), and flies (active consumers).\n- Each category requires a different approach. For instance, to acquire 10 million active users (flies), a product needs to be inherently social with a high viral coefficient or have a ton of user-generated content. To acquire one million consumers or prosumers (mice), some level of virality is needed, along with social sharing.\n- Hunting rabbits (small businesses) is less straightforward and requires a fantastic product, a high net promoter score, and a focus on funnel optimization. Hunting deers (medium-sized companies) requires an inside sales force and the ability to pay attractive commissions to VARs and channel partners.\n- Hunting elephants (enterprise customers) is straightforward if the company has a good solution for a significant problem experienced by large enterprises. However, it requires a founder team with enterprise sales DNA.\n\nMain Takeaways:\n- Identify the type of customer your business is targeting (elephants, deers, rabbits, mice, flies) and tailor your approach accordingly.\n- If targeting consumers or prosumers (mice), focus on virality and social sharing. If targeting small businesses (rabbits), focus on product quality, customer satisfaction, and funnel optimization.\n- If targeting medium-sized companies (deers), consider using an inside sales force and offering attractive commissions to VARs and channel partners. If targeting enterprise customers (elephants), ensure you have a team with enterprise sales DNA.",

She and my father immigrated from Rajasthan, India, to Queens in the mid-1960s. My parents are both smart, hard-working, practical people who don’t really understand what I do at work. I’ve described my work so many times to my sweet, tiny mom (she’s just 4’11”) but she can never remember exactly who I work for. Recently at a party, she proudly told her friends: “My son works at Battery Adventures.” Her friends smiled, but they were disappointed that I was neither a doctor, like my dad, nor working at a brand-name bank like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. Her remark got me thinking. Maybe she captured my career better than I’d realized. Maybe the right way to think about building a company is going on an “adventure,” not merely a “venture.” And perhaps my role as a VC is that of an adventure travel guide: someone who’s climbed the mountain many times before, who knows both the terrain and the phases of the climb intimately, and can serve as a guide for others brave enough to take up the challenge. Techcrunch event Berkeley, CA | June 5 REGISTER NOW I’ve had the amazing fortune to work with many world-class founders over my 15-year tenure in venture, including many B2B, SaaS enterprise-software companies such as Marketo, Omniture, Guidewire, Bazaarvoice and Sprinklr (for a full list of all Battery investments and exits, please click here.) So I’d like to share some stories and advice from my personal travel log — call it a tale of “adventure” and a guide to the mileposts entrepreneurs will need need to traverse to reach their summit: a billion-dollar valuation. 7 Phases of go-to-market success for SaaS companies I believe there are seven key phases in SaaS companies’ go-to-market success. Most of the phases center around a mantra I call “triple, triple, double, double, double,” (T2D3 for short), referring to a company’s annualized revenue growth. This is not the only growth path to SaaS success, as enterprises like Cornerstone, ExactTarget and SuccessFactors have shown, but it is one sure-fire way to get there. Each phase demands a different focus, such as adjusting your sales process; growing your team and your organization strategically; and expanding internationally. You’ll notice that I specify “go-to-market” because there are many other critical phases of SaaS company growth, as well. They include selecting a co-founder, choosing a capital partner, developing a scalable product architecture and fostering a winning company culture, among others. Here, we’re focusing only on the mechanics of the “climb” itself. So grab your outdoor gear — we’re hitting the trail and heading to the peak. Phase 1: Establish a great product-market fit. This involves finding and prioritizing customer pain points, then aligning your product to address those pain points precisely. Many founders ask me how they’ll know they have product-market fit. Unfortunately, there’s no clear test here. I usually ask several prospects or customers in a specific sector to describe their pain points. When I hear consistency across the sample set, I know we’re there. Once the product is developed, it’s easy to run tests to see if customers are actually realizing a benefit. It’s also critical this pain be among the top one or two pain points for the company’s target customer. I’ve noticed over the years that customers never really get to priority three on their list. Phase 2: Get to $2 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). In this phase, the founders are closing all the new sales, so the name of the game is landing the “right” starter clients and perfecting your sales pitch and funnel strategy. Assuming your average deal size in the $30K-$80K range, this means getting to 30-60 customers. Completing this phase usually takes a year or two. Phase 3: Triple to $6 million in ARR. I often see SaaS founders take two paths to reaching this first “triple” goal. In the first scenario, which I call the “hero” approach, the founders close just about every deal. That’s a tenacious strategy, but not scalable. The second, “sales machine” approach is more difficult, but preferable. It involves hiring the right sales leader, plus five to 10 reps, and priming them to scale the next peaks. Perhaps half of these salespeople will be productive during this period, but others will be ramping for the following year. Phase 4: Triple to $18 million. Here’s where the magic kicks in, similar to how you feel when you reach the first base camp on the mountain. Here, renewals and referrals help fuel sales, likely driven by just 10 to 20 sales reps, of which half might be fully ramped. Then you reach another milestone: adding a second layer of sales management underneath the VP of sales. This can be difficult for a founder/CEO, as he or she is now three levels removed from the actual people selling the product. But at the same time, a founder/CEO can really grow during this phase, transitioning to thinking about cultivating new managers and landing really large accounts. The magic moment is when deals start closing that no founder was actively involved in pitching/closing. The seeds for massive scalability are planted here. In my experience, successfully adding a second layer of sales management is one of the most difficult milestones for SaaS companies. Phase 5: Double to $36 million in ARR. This phase involves fielding a team of about 20-30 sales reps and three to five front-line managers. Its major challenge, though, is getting sales in Europe working. International efforts often get started in this phase with a VP or sales rep hired somewhere in EMEA (some combination of U.K., France and Germany). Many companies make the mistake of entering multiple international regions at once. I encourage my founders to get EMEA working first; go deep versus wide. Put a team of three to five reps in the U.K. versus one to two in each country. This allows you to build customer references, develop a playbook and cultivate country leaders who will make sure you have success. Phase 6: Double to $72 million. This phase is rife with operational challenges. Should you promote someone within sales to run your North America division or hire from outside? Hire a worldwide CRO or have EMEA report to the U.S. leader? Another thorny issue many companies tackle here is establishing non-linear growth or getting the reseller or partner channel working. In my experience, it’s premature to get a reseller network up and running for a SaaS company before hitting a $50 million run rate. There are simply just not enough economics for the channel partner to prioritize the effort. In addition, I prefer quality over quantity - just try to get one or two channel partners productive versus dozens. It’s so hard to get even one reseller relationship working in the field. Phase 7: Double to $144 million. The summit is close. The $1 billion valuation milestone, and a potential IPO, are both within sight. However, with luck and hard work, this will be just the beginning. At a recent IPO celebration, the head of NYSE remarked that, for the exchange’s great companies, 90 percent of value is created post-IPO. I firmly believe this. It’s the reason why I invest across early and late venture stages. If I’m doing my job right, all these private companies are just early-stage businesses.

The following chart gives a real-life illustration of how seven high-profile, public SaaS companies we have identified — Marketo, NetSuite, Omniture, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday and Zendesk — each roughly followed this triple, triple, double, double double (T2D3) growth path to achieve their success.

Topics Column, TC Neeraj Agrawal General Partner Neeraj Agrawal is a general partner at Battery Ventures. View Bio\n\nEditor’s note: Neeraj Agrawal is a general partner with Battery Ventures in Boston.\n\n“What does it take to build a billion-dollar SaaS enterprise-software company?” I hear this question a lot in my work as a tech investor, and it’s incredibly tough to answer. I bet mountain climbers feel the same way when they’re asked how they conquered a major summit. The answer is both incremental — you succeed by placing one foot in front of the other, of course — and more pragmatic, in that the journey is always broken into multiple, distinct phases.\n\nYou don’t climb all of Mt. Kilimanjaro in one day, and you don’t build the next SaaS standout quickly, either. Instead, you shrink your focus and keep your goals clear-cut then recognize what the next level looks like and scramble like mad to get there.\n\n“My son works at Battery Adventures”\n\nI started thinking about how my job in venture capital resembles mountain climbing thanks to a very unlikely person: my mom. She and my father immigrated from Rajasthan, India, to Queens in the mid-1960s. My parents are both smart, hard-working, practical people who don’t really understand what I do at work.\n\nI’ve described my work so many times to my sweet, tiny mom (she’s just 4’11”) but she can never remember exactly who I work for. Recently at a party, she proudly told her friends: “My son works at Battery Adventures.” Her friends smiled, but they were disappointed that I was neither a doctor, like my dad, nor working at a brand-name bank like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.\n\nHer remark got me thinking. Maybe she captured my career better than I’d realized. Maybe the right way to think about building a company is going on an “adventure,” not merely a “venture.” And perhaps my role as a VC is that of an adventure travel guide: someone who’s climbed the mountain many times before, who knows both the terrain and the phases of the climb intimately, and can serve as a guide for others brave enough to take up the challenge.\n\nTechcrunch event Berkeley, CA | June 5 REGISTER NOW\n\nTechcrunch event\n\nBerkeley, CA | June 5 REGISTER NOW\n\nBerkeley, CA | June 5\n\nI’ve had the amazing fortune to work with many world-class founders over my 15-year tenure in venture, including many B2B, SaaS enterprise-software companies such as Marketo, Omniture, Guidewire, Bazaarvoice and Sprinklr (for a full list of all Battery investments and exits, please click here.)\n\nSo I’d like to share some stories and advice from my personal travel log — call it a tale of “adventure” and a guide to the mileposts entrepreneurs will need need to traverse to reach their summit: a billion-dollar valuation.\n\n7 Phases of go-to-market success for SaaS companies\n\nI believe there are seven key phases in SaaS companies’ go-to-market success. Most of the phases center around a mantra I call “triple, triple, double, double, double,” (T2D3 for short), referring to a company’s annualized revenue growth.\n\nThis is not the only growth path to SaaS success, as enterprises like Cornerstone, ExactTarget and SuccessFactors have shown, but it is one sure-fire way to get there. Each phase demands a different focus, such as adjusting your sales process; growing your team and your organization strategically; and expanding internationally.\n\nYou’ll notice that I specify “go-to-market” because there are many other critical phases of SaaS company growth, as well. They include selecting a co-founder, choosing a capital partner, developing a scalable product architecture and fostering a winning company culture, among others. Here, we’re focusing only on the mechanics of the “climb” itself. So grab your outdoor gear — we’re hitting the trail and heading to the peak.\n\nPhase 1: Establish a great product-market fit. This involves finding and prioritizing customer pain points, then aligning your product to address those pain points precisely. Many founders ask me how they’ll know they have product-market fit. Unfortunately, there’s no clear test here.\n\nI usually ask several prospects or customers in a specific sector to describe their pain points. When I hear consistency across the sample set, I know we’re there. Once the product is developed, it’s easy to run tests to see if customers are actually realizing a benefit. It’s also critical this pain be among the top one or two pain points for the company’s target customer. I’ve noticed over the years that customers never really get to priority three on their list.\n\nPhase 2: Get to $2 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). In this phase, the founders are closing all the new sales, so the name of the game is landing the “right” starter clients and perfecting your sales pitch and funnel strategy. Assuming your average deal size in the $30K-$80K range, this means getting to 30-60 customers. Completing this phase usually takes a year or two.\n\nPhase 3: Triple to $6 million in ARR. I often see SaaS founders take two paths to reaching this first “triple” goal. In the first scenario, which I call the “hero” approach, the founders close just about every deal. That’s a tenacious strategy, but not scalable.\n\nThe second, “sales machine” approach is more difficult, but preferable. It involves hiring the right sales leader, plus five to 10 reps, and priming them to scale the next peaks. Perhaps half of these salespeople will be productive during this period, but others will be ramping for the following year.\n\nPhase 4: Triple to $18 million. Here’s where the magic kicks in, similar to how you feel when you reach the first base camp on the mountain. Here, renewals and referrals help fuel sales, likely driven by just 10 to 20 sales reps, of which half might be fully ramped. Then you reach another milestone: adding a second layer of sales management underneath the VP of sales.\n\nThis can be difficult for a founder/CEO, as he or she is now three levels removed from the actual people selling the product. But at the same time, a founder/CEO can really grow during this phase, transitioning to thinking about cultivating new managers and landing really large accounts. The magic moment is when deals start closing that no founder was actively involved in pitching/closing.\n\nThe seeds for massive scalability are planted here.

Many people five or six years ago probably thought consumer IoT was going to be driven by startups-when in reality big companies have been the key for most (but not all) consumer IoT applications.Here are some areas I think are especially intriguing for 2019:1. Devsumer* Products. AKA Software Eating Accenture.One past wave of technology innovation was the rise of the professional & consumer market for tech, or the \"prosumer\" market. We are now seeing a new merger of the developer & consumer markets, or \"devsumer\".If you are an operations or business team at a tech company, or basically anybody at a non-tech company, it is hard to get any engineering resources to help build the workflow or productivity tools you need to be successful. Companies will spend hundreds of thousands, to literally hundreds of millions of dollars, hiring the Accentures of the world to build simple applications and tools, or to perform API integrations for them.In parallel, the average knowledge worker has gotten more savvy and hands on. A lot more people have grown up with a computer in the home, have taken a CS class in college (now the most popular major at a number of universities), or gone to a coding bootcamp or school like Lambda School. While not all people exposed to CS end up as full-fledged developers, people on average are more savvy about elements of software and simple code. People are more willing to build things, if they have simple tools available.Just as there was a prior prosumer wave as part of IT productivity 1.0, we are experiencing a new \"devsumer\" wave, where consumers are more likely to take on lighter versions of developer-like work and products.A number of products have emerged that allow people to build simple software applications, or to use templated applications for their own work flow or productivity. You can think of this as taking a SQL database or excel spreadsheet and turning it into an app platform. These companies include Airtable and, in a vertical way specific to internal tools, Retool.In a different market segment, Notion and Coda are focused on the future of docs & productivity software, while other companies, such as Zapier and IFTTT allow you to simply stitch together APIs into workflows. There is the old saying that money is made by either bundling or unbundling products or services. Devsumer companies are virtually re-bundling disparate productivity tools into single companies.By allowing any person to either use an off the shelf template or tool, or create their own by stitching together existing applications, the power of programming is suddenly available to anyone in an enterprise or SMB. These tools can also be used for personal productivity or enterprise productivity.Devsumer products are driven by multiple megatrends including the overall shift to cloud based applications and platforms leading to accessible APIs for integrations plus a savvier white collar workforce that expects software tools to be an integral part of their work and personal lives.There will be multiple $5B+ companies in this market (with Airtable already raising a round at a $1.1B valuation).2. Real estate tech. Software eating real estate.One of the largest TAMs in the world is real estate and much of an individuals' net worth is tied up in their home. In some sense, Airbnb was one of the earliest real estate tech disruptors in that it allowed people to monetize their most expensive asset by renting it out to others.A new wave of real estate technology companies have emerged with Opendoor at the vanguard. Real estate technology companies are experimenting with fractional ownership (Divvy, Harbor), new ways to build homes and neighborhoods (Mosaic, Katerra) and new ways to find rentals (Bungalow). There are also multiple services for home buying finally moving online - for example Qualia for real estate closings or Compass, which has been buying local real estate brokerages in a hybrid online/offline model.3. Machine learning / AI silicon & systems. Every major technology shift creates a $20B+ semiconductor company.Most major technology waves result in a new $10B+ semiconductor company. For example, the rise of the microcomputer led to Intel and AMD, networking to Broadcom, graphics processing and video games to NVIDIA, while mobile technologies resulted in Qualcomm and ARM.Machine learning / AI is a new technology wave with its own silicon & hardware needs. While NVIDIA GPUs are used today by many in machine learning, the underlying hardware is not optimized for the fast I/O and matrix multiplication that would optimize for machine learning. Google launched custom ASICs for ML called TPUs (tensor processing units) but Google is unwilling to sell the hardware externally - in part to give its own cloud services a competitive advantage. This, plus the potential medium term rise of potentially ubiquitous AI models running in autonomous vehicles (self driving cars, drones etc.) yields a massive market opportunity**.Companies like Cerebras, Groq, Graphcore, and others are potential contenders for ML market cap.4. Transportation and logistics. Software eating transportation, logistics, and supply chain.The way physical goods will be moved around the world is changing. The entire transportation and logistics stacks is being eaten by software. The base layer for this - autonomous vehicles is still years away from the mainstream, but has promising early signals. Companies like Embark, Kodiak, Starsky and others are building self driving trucks. On top of this, firms like Convoy and Uber are building load market places and logistics networks for trucking while KeepTruckin and Samsara deal with fleet management and compliance. Companies like Flexport are driving global freight. New robotics companies are trying to automate the warehouse and allow for small urban distribution centers (CommonSense Robotics). Finally, companies like Shippo help with the end user shipping process.5. Crypto. Programmable money and Store of Value.Cryptocurrencies and the underlying set of companies creating the new financial stack promise to be incredibly valuable. Bitcoin and Ethereum still hold immense promise as new forms of programmable money / store of value, in part due to their resistance to seizure and censorship. Despite the crypto winter, new protocols like Chia, Celo, Coda, Oasis, and Thunder are looking to re-invent compute and money while protocols like DIRT ask how to move data onto the blockchain. While a subset of these approaches will undoubtedly fail, there is immense room for innovation.In parallel, a new financial stack is being build to to trade, custody, and derivative crypto in the form of Coinbase, Anchorage, and dYdX with Coinbase acting as one of the very regulatory compliant fiat/crypto on ramps. In parallel, efforts to create new ways to securitize hard assets (Harbor) or for capital formation (Coinlist) are driving other aspects of the early market forward.I am still quite bullish that a basked of cryptocurrencies will be worth in the trillions within the next 10 years. The primary short term driver for crypto value with be the generational replacement of gold as a store-of-value for a specific subset of the population. The longer term drivers of crypto value will be new forms of programable money and on-chain securities.6. TBD: Legal tech. Software eating law firms.While more nascent, a new wave of companies are focused on eating away at the legal world. Atrium is the world's first tech-driven law firm, while companies like Klarity apply machine learning to legal contracts. In parallel, Stripe's Atlas allows companies to incorporate via API. Carta provides cap table management as a basis to branch into other services. It is early days in legal tech but it is possible these early seeds will form deep roots.Given the degree to which legal services have a series of highly repetitive tasks that lawyers and para-legals would prefer not to do, it is surprising more software has not come to this vertical.7. TBD: Defense? Big company employee politics creating a market opportunity.Silicon Valley has its roots in the defense industry. A good overview may be found with Steve Blank. The recent Trump election helped to further radicalize US politics and this political divide has found its way Silicon Valley as well. While a strong national defense matters for the USA irrespective of who the president is, it is suddenly unpopular at a number of companies to accept defense related work. Google shut down project Maven which met with a negative employee response, and employees have protested defense contractors at Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others.The rise of the radicalized worker has created an opportunity for startups to pursue defense work. The defense and intelligence community wants to work with major brands like Google. However, if Google is unwilling to lend its AI expertise, for example, to assess defense video feeds, startups will emerge take on this work.To date, Anduril may be the defense company with the most interest although others like Shield.AI are also in the market. There is an opportunity here to build a next-generation defense company.SummaryIn sum, there are 5 core markets (Devsumer, Real Estate, AI hardware, Transportation and Logistics, Crypto) and 2 emerging ones (Legal, Defense) that seem quite exciting to watch in 2019. While there is a potential darkening macro economic environment, software continues to eat the world and to remake it.NOTES*To coin a term.** The public market caps are from November 2018 as I wrote this blog post a few months ago, but took a while to finish and post it.

    "ai_summary": "Summary:\nThe article by Elad Gil discusses seven key technology trends for 2019. These include the rise of 'devsumer' products, real estate technology, machine learning/AI silicon & systems, transportation and logistics, cryptocurrencies, legal tech, and defense. The author believes that these trends are driven by the ongoing shift to cloud-based applications, the increasing savviness of the workforce, and the continuous integration of software into various industries.\n\nKey Insights:\n- 'Devsumer' products, a merger of developer and consumer markets, are emerging due to the increasing savviness of the average knowledge worker and the shift to cloud-based applications. Companies like Airtable and Retool are leading this trend.\n- Real estate technology is growing with companies like Opendoor, Divvy, and Harbor experimenting with new ways of home ownership, building, and rentals.\n- Machine learning/AI is creating a new wave in the semiconductor industry with companies like Cerebras, Groq, and Graphcore potentially leading the market.\n- The transportation and logistics industry is being transformed by software with companies like Embark, Kodiak, and Starsky developing self-driving trucks, and firms like Convoy and Uber building logistics networks.\n- Cryptocurrencies hold immense promise as new forms of programmable money and store of value, with companies like Coinbase, Anchorage, and dYdX building a new financial stack.\n- Legal tech is an emerging field with companies like Atrium and Klarity applying machine learning to legal contracts.\n- The defense industry is seeing a potential opportunity for startups as big companies like Google become reluctant to accept defense-related work due to employee politics.\n\nMain Takeaways:\n- Companies should leverage the rise of 'devsumer' products to improve their workflow and productivity.\n- Real estate firms should consider adopting new technologies to enhance their services and operations.\n- Businesses should explore the potential of machine learning/AI, transportation and logistics software, and cryptocurrencies to stay competitive.\n- Legal firms and defense companies should consider integrating technology into their operations to improve efficiency and meet changing industry dynamics.",

Examples of past hot markets that turned out to largely be duds include First Wave AI (in the 1980s), Nanotech (as an industry in the early 2000s), CleanTech (early to mid 2000s) and Geo (smaller scale in late 2000s).Hot markets that yielded huge companies and large exits include social networking (mid 2000s -Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), and mobile social (early 2010s - WhatsApp, Instagram). Some large market trends are still playing themselves out as per below including big data, sharing economy and other segments.Below is my view of both what markets are hot in 2015, as well as the likelihood of these market segments being medium term duds[2].1. Gold Rush.Markets That Will Yield Large Stand Alone Companies and Many AcquisitionsBig Data.\"Big data\" as termed in the press has 4 subsegments[3]:(1) Dealing with large amounts of data (Hadoop, Spark, etc.)(2) Smart data. I.e. doing something intelligent with the data you have regardless of the number of petabytes. This is more analytical tools or tools for data scientists.(3) Data center infrastructure (sometimes this gets clustered into \"big data\", sometimes not). Mesos (and Mesosphere) would be an example of this. (4) Verticalized data apps (e.g. data store and analytics for medical insurance claims).In general this market segment has a lot of legs and will continue to create both stand alone public companies, as well as has a large number of natural acquirers. Potential acquirers include the traditional enterprise companies (HP, IBM, etc.) as well as the earliest companies in the space who support liquid public stock or large market caps (e.g. Cloudera, Hortonworks...). Additionally, the verticalized data companies for healthcare (and 2-3 other key verticals) will see large of exits to more specialized acquirers (e.g. UnitedHealth for healthcare data companies).SaaS [Software as a Service - including APIs/developer tools]As recent players with explosive growth (e.g. Zenefits and Slack) have shown, SaaS still has a lot of legs for everything from enterprise collaboration tools to HR back office management. I would not be surprised if there will be 1-2 very large companies (or exits) created here per year for the next few years. The key will be to find differentiated organic distribution (Slack) or business model (Zenefits).To prevent the listing of too many submarkets, I will toss APIs/developer tools into this bucket as well. There are lots of services that make sense as an API that traditionally have been performed in a more cumbersome way. Stripe and Twilio are canonical examples of this trend, Checkr.io a more recent one.Genomics.Genomics hasn't hit the mainstream hype cycle yet. However I think in late 2015 or early 2016 it will emerge as a hot area of investment due to the fundamental underlying shifts in the market. I think this will yield both a large area of future investment, but also exits ranging in the $100M to multi-billion dollar range. The genomics wave will include both stand alone genomics software companies (lots of natural buyers including IBM, Oracle, Google, Illumina, and others) as well as more traditional biology centric genomics (with large natural buyers in the pharma and traditional biotech markets). I think a small number of large, public companies will emerge in genomics.2. Silver Mines.Markets That Will Yield Lots of Acquisitions, Less Clear on Independent Stand-AlonesAI.There are two types of AI companies:(1) Companies trying to develop general purpose AI or are trying to build a \"general AI platform\".(2) Companies applying AI to solve a very specific problem or customer need (e.g. machine translation of web pages or screening pathology samples).The first group of companies will be small to large acquisitions by Google, Facebook and handful of other companies as talent buys. The second class of companies may yield a small number of large, stand alone, independent businesses. I am more bullish on the prospects of the second group as truly value creating. However, if your primary interest is fast time to exit companies in group (1) will likely sell quickly and at a good valuation 1-4 years post founding as Google and others try to stock up on machine learning talent.IoT [Internet of Things].IoT is a sexy rebranding of \"consumer electronics and appliances\". IoT is modernizing our clunky old school devices in the home and adding software and APIs to allow for seamless interoperability and broaden logging and use of data.Today's traditional consumer electronics and appliances remind me of the Motorola Razr right before the iPhone - great industrial design but no real use of software. From an exit perspective large companies like Google, Apple, Samsung, Philips, GE, and others all have an interest in acquiring companies that will accelerate their own efforts in this market. So there are a lot of natural acquirers in the space. I expect more small to large $500M+ exits in this market, but it is unclear to me which of the new batch of companies will create a long term, sustainable public company of their own. Now that Nest is gone, I would love to hear what others think are the likely long term stand-alone companies in IoT.Security.This is a tougher market to crack as a startup hoping to become a massive standalone company, but I expect more startups here in 2015. On the enterprise side there will be ongoing high-profile hackings and the need to purchase security products. Barriers to entry in this market are higher due to the need for both a strong sales channel as well as a differentiated product, which will temper overall market momentum. Basically, a small number of startups will have ongoing small and medium (hundreds of millions of dollars) exits, but the total carrying capacity of this industry is more limited for startups due to sales channel bottlenecks (CIOs will only want to buy security software from a handful of vendors, and too many new startups will focus on a \"feature\" rather then comprehensive solution).Recently public Palo Alto Networks and FireEye will likely be industry consolidators as will other traditional enterprise security companies.3. Roulette.Binary Markets - Create A Few Huge Stand-Alones, Lots of FailuresSharing Economy & On Demand Economy.Distributed labor and work forces, or the sharing of resources will continue be a hot market from a startup founding perspective. I think the vast majority of the new startups will fail although a handful will still emerge as big hits. Just as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn where the first wave giants in social, AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, Instacart are the first giants of this wave (by market cap). Similarly, just as there was a second social wave that yielded break out companies (WhatsApp, Pinterest, Instagram) as well as tons of duds, the shared economy/distributed labor trend will have a few more huge companies emerge. In general this is an area that will be fraught with lots of failures offset by a handful or truly massive outcomes. Too many entrepreneurs will do derivative \"Uber for X\" for tiny markets (\"Uber for sports equipment delivery\"). The key will be to figure out how to capture an existing large market (e.g. Uber and transportation) or expand an existing market dramatically (Uber again) with a simple use case and product. The people who win here will win big a they upend entire markets.4. Tough Short Term Markets For Tech Investors?Bitcoin.While I am bullish on the long term prospects of crypto currencies and blockchain, I wonder if many of the current crop of companies will succeed. A number of larger structural events need to occur for truly widespread adoption of bitcoin to occur. Existing bitcoin companies have a ticking clock (aka burning through fundraises) relative to this market timing. Profitable (or cash rich) bitcoin companies may make it long enough to see this transition just as AOL did with the Interent[4], but any company burning rapidly through its cash will likely fail. Once a company succeeds sufficiently there will be a large number of potential buyers for BTC companies (including Google, Apple, Microsoft, eBay, and the entire financial system).I expect there to be an eventual culling of existing bitcoin companies followed in a few years by a massive expansion of cryptocurrency companies when the markets are more mature. This may be a hard slog for a few years punctuated by one or two large, misleading, exits [5]. Then there will be an explosion in cryptocurrency companies that dwarfs the current trend. So, I am extremely bullish on this area long term, but worry about the shorter term dynamics.Biotech Investments By Software Investors.Outside of genomics, I have increasingly seen technology investors invest in traditional biotech companies. While genomics has a clear \"why now\" statement due to its rapidly dropping costs, old school biotech does not share this big shift in market dynamics. In my opinion this market is going to be a fiasco for tech investors as they misunderstand the industry structure (regulatory issues, IP issues etc.) as well as don't have a good sense for the underlying markets. While biotech investors may or may not do well in biotech over the next few years (I honestly don't know the market well enough to be certain) I think a subset tech investors may end up loosing big sums of money here (similar to the CleanTech fiasco of the early 2000s).Other markets I missed? Comments on existing ones? Let me know on Twitter.Thanks to Avichal Garg for comments on this post.NOTES[1] \"Success\" is defined for the purposes of this blog post as the creation of a large stand alone company or a as a large financial exit. This is used as a proxy here for impact to the world, as \"impact\" is very hard to quantify. How many lives were saved by Google? Yet Google has transformed the world for the better by providing information access to billions of people. It is hard to come up with a good metric for doing good for the world.[2] Like all prognostication, I will undoubtedly get a bunch of this wrong. This is just my current view of the world, and is obviously subject to change as more data gets generated by that wonderful physics simulation software that we call reality.[3] From a founder perspective.[4] AOL is a similar example for the Internet. AOL was founded in the 1980s and managed to work out an existence until the early 90s, when the bigger Internet wave really hit. By the late 90s AOL was one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization. The next wave of Internet companies were founded a decade later then AOL, when enough infrastructure (markup, browsers, more physical wiring upgrades) allowed for the real Internet boom to occur (Amazon, eBay, Yahoo!, Google, etc.)[5] Big companies often make large, stupid buys for \"strategic\" reasons.M&A LadderWhat Is Your Startup Acquisition Really Worth?5 Reasons To Sell Your StartupAcquisition Blues\n\nCaveat emptor - about 50% of the markets that are considered hot at any given point turn out to be false alarms.

The below shows both the areas in which I believe are interesting to invest in and also those trends I think are important to think about for later stage companies.What I am excited about for 2019.1. InfluencersI believe we are only scratching at the surface on influencers and we’re investing heavily around this theme. Whether it be Haus Beauty with Lady Gaga, Goop with Gwyneth Paltrow, Brandable with a different influencer for each CPG brand, or Cameo which allows influencers to monetize their time starting with the video autograph, this is a space my partners at Lightspeed and I believe in.The celebrity with 100m followers is how we started; Then came the influencer with 1m followers; and now brands are catching onto the long-tail of micro influencers. Going forward I am really excited about the micro micro influencers — those people who may only have hundreds of followers / friends but are the trendsetter in their group of friends and followed by everyone in their school or neighborhood. I believe we will see the rise of ambassador programs in 2019. Glossier once stated 80% of their growth comes from peer-to-peer channels showing the importance of “ambassador” recommendations. Rothy’s (a Lightspeed company) doesn’t have an official ambassador program but it also doesn’t stop women acting as unofficial ambassadors and spreading the word about a product they love wherever they go. We can all be our own version of an influencer in smaller networks and in powerful ways.A message from Harley “Epic Meal Time” Morenstein | CameoHappy New Year — from Brandable’s Super Snack Time influencer, Harleywww.cameo.com2. The Future of CitiesCities of the future will be green, using solar power, with buildings that talk to one another but the largest difference to today will be in transport. The sharing economy in transport has only just begun. Electric scooters, skateboards and bikes have been available for own purchase for years but it was the introduction of the shared version that found real product market fit. The number of young people buying their own car is falling and I expect the same to be seen for bikes, mopeds and scooters as the sharing ecosystem continues to permeate in transport.We are moving towards a time where no one needs a car and if Uber and Lyft are too expensive an option then other options such as Via may be the answer, where they have analyzed the data of NYC, DC and Chicago trips to allow consumers to ride from just $3.65 a trip. These vehicles will become our time to work, shop, play games and socialize both online and in the vehicle.3. Cannabis — THC and CBD Becoming MainstreamAs we can see from the performance of the public Canadian cannabis companies, this space is on fire. As it is legalized, especially at a federal level, the costs and prices will come down significantly and entrepreneurs will continue to flock into the space. However, legalization will open it up to become mainstream and demand will significantly increase as was seen in Canada when they started to run out of cannabis just two days after it was legalized.The products themselves will become commoditized so you need to have a strong brand that customers know, love and trust. The opportunity areas I am most excited about are the marketplaces and brands that will be created within both cannabis strands, THC and CBD. Perhaps your company starts as an offline Retailer (e.g. MedMen), perhaps it starts as an online marketplace (e.g. Eaze, Meadow) or perhaps it’s a brand that consumers love (e.g. a cannabis version of La Croix water or a favorite food but with the ability to relieve your headache, anxiety, PMS and back pain).4. New Business Models for MediaBuilding content for an ad revenue business model worked in the last generation of media businesses but no longer. With 72% of ad dollars going to Facebook and Google and 90% of the growth going to those two, it is increasingly difficult for ad revenue businesses to grow.Instead, it is those who can adapt to new business models that we are excited about. Specifically those using content to a) drive commerce, b) drive a community and c) drive users to pay for a subscription because if the content is that good, then users will be willing to pay for it. I recently wrote about this theme and believe 2019 will see far more successful models like Goop, Glossier & Museum of Ice Cream where content moves to subscription, commerce & experiences.Within these areas, video is a medium I believe will continue to increase in importance. The depth and breadth of YouTube videos offer the type of subscription that customers would be willing to pay for. The comments drive a community angle and Cheddar (a Lightspeed company) take this community to the next level by enabling users to see the comments on the screen as they are watching. The next generation is growing up watching videos (often the only way their parents are able to keep them quiet) and will see video as their go-to media channel.5. Gaming Across PlatformsAR and voice-first gaming are two areas within games I’m also excited about.The AR market is predicted to be $133BN by 2021 and I believe those who are building both the games and the underlying toolkit will have a unique and differentiated product. Illumix was my first investment in this space and their first two games are set to launch in 2019.Gaming has always been a key use case for every consumer platform and we are starting to see this in voice. Early use cases in voice were news and music with the odd “Alexa, tell me a joke” but voice platforms are now starting to see compelling games being built. Alexa and Google Home were rolled into the home as a trojan horse being rolled through the gates but we believe they will be used for far more than playing music and gaming is a logical next step. Discovery remains an issue so we wait for the voice equivalent of the App Store to emerge but in the mean time, there are now 100m Alexia devices in the home so this is a space we will hear more from.6. The Message Behind True BrandsIt’s no secret that Gen Z and Millennials shop differently. They care far more about what a brand stands for, where it is positioned and what impact it has on society. The reason Rothy’s and AllBirds resonate so strongly with consumers (other than the incredible comfort and machine washability!) is the fact they are sustainable and good for the environment. Rothy’s are made from plastic recycled bottles and every box tells you how many have been recycled. That is a message that matters.We have already seen many D2C brands explode onto our credit card statements but I believe the ones that have the staying power will be those that stand for something. This is especially true for younger consumers who care far more about the environment, causes and charities than older generations.7. Be Everywhere the Customer IsIt’s not just online and offline, it’s much more than that. It’s being everywhere the customer is and selling to them where they are.For example, Cotopaxi started D2C and realized that their customer was spending their time running marathons and doing adventure courses so they started their own, Questival. The smart thing about Questival is that people buy Cotopaxi D2C to attend and then they can also buy more gear once there. The definition of being where your customer is — even if it’s down a ditch.Another good example, for a different type of customer, is Goop (a Lightspeed company). They know that their customer is not always online. They know that they spend their summers in the Hamptons and their winters skiing in Aspen so they launched pop-up shops in those luxurious locations. They know their customer is curious and a trendsetter so they launched their Health Summit, In Goop Health, to both drive the community, commerce and content exactly where the customer wanted to be.8. Know Yourself and Your Health… and Gamify ItThe mainstreaming of quantified self is a key trend for 2019. Our body is a machine and the nervous system, gut and brain are more closely intertwined than we realize. Monitoring our steps with a Fitbit is one thing but what about monitoring our anxiety/anger levels with a hitbit, focus levels with a gritbit or microbiome with a shitbit.In Europe, people still ask “what is a coach” and “what is anxiety” (both of which I was asked last week) but the US is realizing the importance of identifying IBS, anxiety and everything else in-between. We are starting to pay attention to our health and spend our own dollars on preventative medicine. At home testing, meditation, therapists & fitness apps are just the start.Health and fitness in our home are on the rise with fitness apps such as Sweat with Kayla and Aaptiv but customer retention in all areas of fitness is poor. Social and gamification is one way to improve it. Peloton lead the way in at home IoT fitness but there is now Tonal, Mirror, Pilates Wheel and more. The psychology behind spending $2k on a Peloton bike may guilt customers into using it but the 90%+ retention after a year shows the power of gamification, a fun product experience and a strong community angle.9. IRL ExperiencesWhether it be due to data concerns, time spent online, less time with loved ones (or Apple pushing the feature for us to now see how long we spend on our phone) there is a rising technology pushback. Young people say they want less dependency on social media and technology overall and more IRL experiences.2018 was the year of Museum of Ice Cream (and rose, candy, color, pizza and eggs) as people flock to novelty, fun and the chance to hang with their friends in person. The desire, and one could argue ‘need’, of these IRL experiences is only just beginning.LVMH recently bought the Belmond hotel chain, for $3.2bn, as they realize the next generation cares far more about experiences than physical goods. Experiential luxury is the new form of luxury.10. Expansion for DNVBsWith current digitally native vertical brands (DNVBs), I continue to discuss the opportunities to expand in physical stores and internationally.In the early days of pop-up shops and permanent retail locations, with brands such as Bonobos, many thought of retail expansion as a cost neutral marketing channel. Well, it can now be thought of as a profitable marketing channel given many brands find their stores break even in just 12 months. The store attracts customers, drives word of mouth and also has a halo impact on the online sales in that geography. To test retail expansion in a smaller way, the new versions of a department store are worth checking out with B8ta and Neighborhood Goods.I believe 2019 will be the year we see far more international expansion from DNVBs. Several companies started to dip their toe into the water in 2018 and learned a great deal. 2019 will see them diving in having now tested the water. If your company is interested in testing international expansion in a smaller way, I recommend working with a company such as Flow, who offer a brand of any size the option to sell internationally.Happy New Year!Watch the video here: https://www.cameo.com/v/PWqioc2vk☞ To hear more of my thoughts in the future, follow me on Twitter☞ If you liked this post, Please “clap” to help to promote this piece to others\n\nReflections and PredictionsNicole Quinn9 min read·Jan 7, 2019--\n\nReflections and Predictions\n\nNicole Quinn9 min read·Jan 7, 2019--\n\nNicole Quinn9 min read·Jan 7, 2019\n\nNicole Quinn\n\n9 min read·Jan 7, 2019\n\n“The consumer has never been this strong” was the underlying message from my predictions post in Jan 2017. It may seem that times are still strong but just a few weeks ago the S&P hit an intraday low which was down 20.2% from the peak and in bear market territory. The market bounced back a little but the leading indicators for our economy tell a worrisome story. The housing market has weakened, with geographies such as New York down 20% yoy; The yield curve has inverted, historically occurring 1 - 3 years before a recession; High beta stocks such as Retail and Tech names have underperformed recently; Retail spending is lackluster; and the political situation in our country is uncertain to say the least.The macro situation is far from ideal but as Airbnb, Uber, Square, WeWork and Stripe (who were all founded in the depth of the last recession) will show you, when looking at uncertain economic times, therein lies the opportunity.So, where are the next opportunities?Our job as investors, is indeed to source, judge and invest in good companies but it is also to be a good board member and thought partner to our CEOs. The below shows both the areas in which I believe are interesting to invest in and also those trends I think are important to think about for later stage companies.What I am excited about for 2019.1. InfluencersI believe we are only scratching at the surface on influencers and we’re investing heavily around this theme. Whether it be Haus Beauty with Lady Gaga, Goop with Gwyneth Paltrow, Brandable with a different influencer for each CPG brand, or Cameo which allows influencers to monetize their time starting with the video autograph, this is a space my partners at Lightspeed and I believe in.The celebrity with 100m followers is how we started; Then came the influencer with 1m followers; and now brands are catching onto the long-tail of micro influencers. Going forward I am really excited about the micro micro influencers — those people who may only have hundreds of followers / friends but are the trendsetter in their group of friends and followed by everyone in their school or neighborhood. I believe we will see the rise of ambassador programs in 2019. Glossier once stated 80% of their growth comes from peer-to-peer channels showing the importance of “ambassador” recommendations. Rothy’s (a Lightspeed company) doesn’t have an official ambassador program but it also doesn’t stop women acting as unofficial ambassadors and spreading the word about a product they love wherever they go. We can all be our own version of an influencer in smaller networks and in powerful ways.A message from Harley “Epic Meal Time” Morenstein | CameoHappy New Year — from Brandable’s Super Snack Time influencer, Harleywww.cameo.com2. The Future of CitiesCities of the future will be green, using solar power, with buildings that talk to one another but the largest difference to today will be in transport. The sharing economy in transport has only just begun. Electric scooters, skateboards and bikes have been available for own purchase for years but it was the introduction of the shared version that found real product market fit. The number of young people buying their own car is falling and I expect the same to be seen for bikes, mopeds and scooters as the sharing ecosystem continues to permeate in transport.We are moving towards a time where no one needs a car and if Uber and Lyft are too expensive an option then other options such as Via may be the answer, where they have analyzed the data of NYC, DC and Chicago trips to allow consumers to ride from just $3.65 a trip. These vehicles will become our time to work, shop, play games and socialize both online and in the vehicle.3.

      "summary": "April 2005This summer, as an experiment, some friends and I are giving seed funding to a bunch of new startups. It's an experiment because we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would.

      "full_content": "April 2005This summer, as an experiment, some friends and I are giving seed funding to a bunch of new startups. It's an experiment because we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would. That's why we're doing it during the summer — so even college students can participate.We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful startups. And we know from experience that some undergrads are as capable as most grad students. The accepted age for startup founders has been creeping downward. We're trying to find the lower bound. The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications. We expected to divide them into two categories, promising and unpromising. But we soon saw we needed a third: promising people with unpromising ideas. [1]The Artix PhaseWe should have expected this. It's very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did.Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started. In January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called Artix. The plan was to put art galleries on the Web. In retrospect, I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid. Galleries are not especially excited about being on the Web even now, ten years later. They don't want to have their stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. [2]Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on earth. They didn't become art dealers after a difficult choice between that and a career in the hard sciences. Most of them had never seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be on it. Some didn't even have computers. It doesn't do justice to the situation to describe it as a hard sell; we soon sank to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries even to do that.Gradually it dawned on us that instead of trying to make Web sites for people who didn't want them, we could make sites for people who did. In fact, software that would let people who wanted sites make their own. So we ditched Artix and started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores. That one succeeded.We're in good company here. Microsoft was not the first company Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either. The first was called Traf-o-data. It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft. In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix. I dragged him into it. [3] But there were moments when he was optimistic. And if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.The Still Life EffectWhy does this happen? Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?Let's look at our case. One reason we had such a lame idea was that it was the first thing we thought of. I was in New York trying to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway. When I learned about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two. Make Web sites for galleries — that's the ticket!If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head. You'd think. But people don't. In fact, this is a constant problem when you're painting still lifes. You plonk down a bunch of stuff on a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to look interesting. But you're so impatient to get started painting that ten minutes of rearranging feels very long. So you start painting. Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at it, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and boring composition, but by then it's too late.Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small ones. You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have a spare hour, and days later you're still working on it. I once spent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in about four minutes. At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought I'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change.So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point (a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that this must be the idea.How do we fix that? I don't think we should discard plunging. Plunging into an idea is a good thing. The solution is at the other end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make it good.This is clearest in the case of names. Viaweb was originally called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called that. We were so attached to our name that we offered him 5% of the company if he'd let us have it. But he wouldn't, so we had to think of another. [4] The best we could do was Viaweb, which we disliked at first. It was like having a new mother. But within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and old-fashioned.If it's hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine how hard it is to garbage-collect an idea. A name only has one point of attachment into your head. An idea for a company gets woven into your thoughts. So you must consciously discount for that. Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your idea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something people will pay for? Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing people will pay most for?MuckThe second mistake we made with Artix is also very common. Putting galleries on the Web seemed cool.One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass. Meaning that unpleasant work pays. And more to the point here, vice versa. Work people like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand. The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which doesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for free.When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business. I wanted to keep one foot in the art world. Big, big, mistake. Going into business is like a hang-glider launch: you'd better do it wholeheartedly, or not at all. The purpose of a company, and a startup especially, is to make money. You can't have divided loyalties.Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose is patent litigation. What I mean is, if you're starting a company that will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident. Unless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to happen at all.HyenasWhen I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity. If you'd proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business, we'd have found the idea terrifying. Surely a field like that would be dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VC money each. Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own in the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites for art galleries.We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety. As it turns out, VC-backed startups are not that fearsome. They're too busy trying to spend all that money to get software written. In 1995, the e-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press releases, but not as measured in software. And really it never was. The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just consulting companies pretending to be product companies [5], and the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines of Perl scripts. Or could have been implemented as a couple hundred lines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines of C++ or Java. Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.So why were we afraid? We felt we were good at programming, but we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated thing we called \"business.\" In fact there is no such thing as \"business.\" There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising money, and so on. And the combination is not as hard as it seems, because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated) are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others (like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination than any kind of special training.Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we were afraid of the lions. Except the lions turned out not to have any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely qualified as carrion.A Familiar ProblemSum up all these sources of error, and it's no wonder we had such a bad idea for a company. We did the first thing we thought of; we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately chose an impoverished market to avoid competition.Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see signs of all three. But the first is by far the biggest problem. Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the things we could do, is this the one with the best chance of making money?If they'd already been through their Artix phase, they'd have learned to ask that. After the reception we got from art dealers, we were ready to. This time, we thought, let's make something people want.Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas for two or three new startups. The articles are full of descriptions of problems that need to be solved. But most of the applicants don't seem to have looked far for ideas.We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games. We were not far off: this was the second most common. The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar, a dating site, and Friendster. Maybe there is some new killer app to be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around in this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying about in the open for anyone to see. Why did no one propose a new scheme for micropayments? An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can't believe we've considered every alternative. And newspapers and magazines are (literally) dying for a solution.Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want? I think the problem with many, as with people in their early twenties generally, is that they've been trained their whole lives to jump through predefined hoops. They've spent 15-20 years solving problems other people have set for them. And how much time deciding what problems would be good to solve? Two or three course projects? They're good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.But that, I'm convinced, is just the effect of training. Or more precisely, the effect of grading. To make grading efficient, everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to be decided in advance. It would be great if schools taught students how to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don't know how you'd run such a class in practice.Copper and TinThe good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned. I know that from experience. Hackers can learn to make things customers want. [6]This is a controversial view. One expert on \"entrepreneurship\" told me that any startup had to include business people, because only they could focus on what customers wanted. I'll probably alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it, because his email was such a perfect example of this view: 80% of MIT spinoffs succeed provided they have at least one management person in the team at the start. The business person represents the \"voice of the customer\" and that's what keeps the engineers and product development on track. This is, in my opinion, a crock. Hackers are perfectly capable of hearing the voice of the customer without a business person to amplify the signal for them. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad students in computer science, which presumably makes them \"engineers.\" Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business guy whispering in their ears what customers wanted? It seems to me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting started.The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring out that you need to figure it out. But that's something you can learn quickly. It's like seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous picture. As soon as someone tells you there's a rabbit as well as a duck, it's hard not to see it.And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving, giving customers what they want is easy. Anyone who can write an optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn't confuse users, once they choose to focus on that problem. And once you apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions, you can create wealth very rapidly.That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that's beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don't — because they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing \"research,\" and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing refrigerators. [7]If you want to learn what people want, read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. [8] When a friend recommended this book, I couldn't believe he was serious. But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was right. It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience: how to see things from other people's point of view, instead of thinking only of yourself.Most smart people don't do that very well. But adding this ability to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper. The result is bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful. And not just at making money: look what a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox.Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the same way that not drinking anything would teach you how much you depend on water. But it would be more convenient for all involved if the Summer Founders didn't learn this on our dime — if they could skip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers wanted. That, I think, is going to be the real experiment this summer. How long will it take them to grasp this? We decided we ought to have T-Shirts for the SFP, and we'd been thinking about what to print on the back. Till now we'd been planning to use If you can read this, I should be working. but now we've decided it's going to be Make something people want. Notes[1] SFP applicants: please don't assume that not being accepted means we think your idea is bad. Because we want to keep the number of startups small this first summer, we're going to have to turn down some good proposals too.[2] Dealers try to give each customer the impression that the stuff they're showing him is something special that only a few people have seen, when in fact it may have been sitting in their racks for years while they tried to unload it on buyer after buyer.[3] On the other hand, he was skeptical about Viaweb too. I have a precise measure of that, because at one point in the first couple months we made a bet: if he ever made a million dollars out of Viaweb, he'd get his ear pierced. We didn't let him off, either.[4] I wrote a program to generate all the combinations of \"Web\" plus a three letter word. I learned from this that most three letter words are bad: Webpig, Webdog, Webfat, Webzit, Webfug. But one of them was Webvia; I swapped them to make Viaweb.[5] It's much easier to sell services than a product, just as it's easier to make a living playing at weddings than by selling recordings. But the margins are greater on products. So during the Bubble a lot of companies used consulting to generate revenues they could attribute to the sale of products, because it made a better story for an IPO.[6] Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: \"Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution.\"[7] You need to offer especially large rewards to get great people to do tedious work. That's why startups always pay equity rather than just salary.[8] Buy an old copy from the 1940s or 50s instead of the current edition, which has been rewritten to suit present fashions. The original edition contained a few unPC ideas, but it's always better to read an original book, bearing in mind that it's a book from a past era, than to read a new version sanitized for your protection.Thanks to Bill Birch, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\n\n80% of MIT spinoffs succeed provided they have at least one management person in the team at the start.

The author emphasizes the importance of understanding what customers want, avoiding the allure of 'cool' but unprofitable ideas, and not being afraid of competition. The article also highlights the importance of learning to choose the right problems to solve, rather than just being good at solving problems.\n\n2. Key Insights:\n- Smart people often make the mistake of going with the first idea that comes to their mind without considering its profitability or customer demand.\n- Many smart people are attracted to 'cool' ideas that may not be profitable, due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between work people like and its pay.\n- Fear of competition often leads smart people to choose safer, less competitive, and less profitable markets.\n- Smart people are often good at solving problems but bad at choosing which problems to solve. This is often due to their training and education, which focuses on solving predefined problems rather than identifying valuable ones.\n- Hackers or programmers can learn to understand what customers want and create profitable solutions if they focus on these issues.\n\n3. Main Takeaways:\n- When starting a business, it's crucial to consider the profitability and customer demand for your idea, not just its appeal or novelty.\n- Don't shy away from competition or choose less profitable markets out of fear. Instead, leverage your skills and intelligence to compete effectively.\n- Learn to identify valuable problems to solve, rather than just being good at solving problems. This skill can be developed with experience and conscious effort.",

Even if you’re not building a B2B startup right now, you’ll find inspiration, new ideas, and frameworks that will help you with the product you’re building right now. Here is what’s in store:Part 1: How to come up with a great B2B startup idea ← This postPart 2: How to validate your ideaPart 3: How to identify your ICPPart 4: How to find and win your first 10 customersPart 5: How to find product-market fitPart 6: How, and when, to hire your early teamPart 7: How to scale your growth engineYou’ll find never-before-shared stories, surprising lessons, and, as usual — a ton of tactical and actionable advice you can use to grow your own product today.Here’s a peek at a few of the more surprising takeaways:The majority of founders had no special skill or background in the problem space they went after.Most B2B startup ideas did not come from the founder feeling the pain at their last gig (though many did).Every prosumer product (e.g. Notion, Figma, Airtable, Miro, Slack, Coda) took two to four years of wandering in the dark before they found something that worked.Founders spoke to a median of 30 potential customers to validate their idea before committing.~40% of startups pivoted at least once before landing on their winning idea — oftentimes more than once.About 20% were solo founders.Cold outbound works — it’s the second most common way to get your early customers.This series should probably be a book, but instead I’m sharing it with you all here. I’m excited to hear what you think and evolve this work further. And remember: following these steps (or any steps!) won’t guarantee success. But it’ll certainly improve your odds. Let’s get started with step one: coming up with a great idea.A huge thank-you to Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Ali Ghodsi (CEO of Databricks), Barry McCardel (CEO of Hex), Boris Jabes (CEO of Census), Calvin French-Owen (co-founder of Segment), Cameron Adams (co-founder and CPO of Canva), Christina Cacioppo (CEO of Vanta), David Hsu (CEO of Retool), Eilon Reshef (CPO of Gong), Eric Glyman (CEO of Ramp), Guy Podjarny (CEO of Snyk), Jori Lallo (co-founder of Linear), Julianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel (co-founders of Stytch), Mathilde Collin (CEO of Front), Rick Song (CEO of Persona), Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng (co-founders of Zip), Ryan Glasgow (CEO of Sprig), Shahed Khan (co-founder of Loom), Shishir Mehrotra (CEO of Coda), Sho Kuwamoto (VP of Product of Figma), Spenser Skates (co-founder and CEO of Amplitude), and Tomer London (co-founder and CPO of Gusto) for contributing to this series. Art by Natalie Harney.If you boil it down, there are essentially three elements to a great B2B startup idea:There need to be a lot of people willing to spend a lot of money to solve the problem. Most startups fail not because the idea isn’t good but because the market for the solution is just too small. If you want to build a venture-scale business, a rule of thumb is that there needs to be a clear path to $100m in revenue per year, and eventually a path to $1B a year. Here’s a great example of what you want to see, as told by Ryan Glasgow, CEO of Sprig:“Robinhood agreed to a large contract even though we were early. They’re like, ‘We love it. We’ll install tomorrow.’ They installed it as we were building the first version.”Hunter Walk has a great framework called LUV. Also, here’s my take on what makes a venture-scale idea, and a guide to help you think through your market size.Existing solutions need to be doing a subpar job of solving the problem. The founder of CRED, Kunal Shah, has a great framework for evaluating potential new solutions, called Delta-4:What would a customer rate the existing solution on a scale of 1 to 10?What would they rate your solution?Your solution needs to be +4 better for anyone to care about your product. This also means that if the existing solution gets a 6 or higher, it’ll be very hard to replace (e.g. Excel). Here’s what you’d love to see, as shared by Tomer London, co-founder of Gusto:“As soon as we asked them the simple question of how they feel about their current payroll provider, they started cursing. More than half of the people we talked to just started cursing, unprompted. Two people voluntarily told me, ‘I use [competitor name], and my password is fuck[competitor name].’”Finally, the problem needs to be something you are willing to spend many years of your life solving. This advice from Dylan Field, co-founder of Figma, captures the sentiment perfectly:“There are actually a lot of good ideas out there. It’s kind of the weird part, especially if you’re searching for one; it feels like it’s not the case, but there are so many different markets that are underserved. The more important thing, actually, is to find something that you are personally passionate about, because any good company takes a long time to build.If you are, let’s say, three to four years in on an idea that you hate, you’re just going to burn out and you’re going to quit. It won’t feel good and you’ll be hating life. Don’t just go for an idea because it’s kind of working. Go for an idea that you really care about, because even if it doesn’t work, you’ll still learn from it and you’ll still have one.” — Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, via Elad GilTakeaway: Find an idea that solves a problem that is important, underserved, and that you’re excited about. You’ll hear a lot more about how to do this, and what this looks and feels like, below.“It’s essential to work on something you’re deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.” — Paul GrahamAcross all of the interviews I did, I found three reliable paths for discovering a great idea:Past pain: Identify a large pain you experienced at a previous company — then build a solution.Ponder and probe: Pick a space you’re interested in, then whiteboard and tinker while talking to dozens of potential customers — looking intently for pain and pull.Present pull: Identify something you’ve built that is showing signs of pull — and pivot fully to that.Here’s an overview of how today’s biggest B2B companies found their ideas:No matter which path you take, you are looking for two things: pain and pull. Pain tells you there’s an opportunity to solve a problem, and that it’s important. Pull tells you that you’re actually solving the problem.Let’s explore each of the three paths, illustrated by founder stories.When I first started this research, I was expecting this path to be the way that all great startups found their ideas. Surprisingly, it only accounts for about 40% of great ideas.Let’s consider five successful startups that found their big idea following the path of past pain: Gong, Retool, Linear, Persona, and Hex.The CEO of Gong experienced the pain of being unable to understand what was going wrong within the sales process at his previous company:“Amit, now my co-founder, ran a company in the BI space called Sisense. He ran into a problem — when sales didn’t work well — and it was very hard to understand why. He realized that essentially all of the knowledge about what was working and not working was hidden inside people’s heads: ‘The CRM was showing me stuff, but it wasn’t anything meaningful. Yes, you didn’t close that deal, but why?’He left Sisense and looked around to see if anybody was addressing this problem. I was on sabbatical doing nothing, learning deep learning, so we figured: let’s try to come up with a system that takes the stuff from salespeople’s heads, captures the information, and gives visibility and guidance to the rest of the organization.” — Eilon Reshef, co-founder and CPODavid Hsu, the founder of Retool, found himself building the same product over and over at each company he worked at:“Perhaps a little-known fact is that I had actually started a couple of other companies and products before Retool. And every time the team built any of these products, we had to go build our own tools for it. Eventually, when you build enough of the same things — in this instance, internal tools for different projects — you kind of realize they actually all have the same building blocks. We thought, ‘There’s got to be a better way of doing this.’ And we’re lazy engineers and we thought other engineers would be lazy as well. So that’s how the idea [for Retool] first came about.” — David Hsu, founder and CEOThe founders of Linear felt deeply disappointed every time their companies defaulted to Jira:“Linear emerged out of the pain we all felt with issue tracking project management, when it comes to building software. I was at the time at Coinbase, Karri [Saarinen, co-founder] was at Airbnb, Tuomas [Artman, co-founder] was at Uber. We were all at these growth-stage companies and saw how they both grow and operated as they grew.I very vividly remember the time around 2016 at Coinbase, when we were closing in on 100 people and we hired a VP of engineering. There was a desire to start unifying the teams using a single tool. And Jira started coming up in the conversations.I was maybe a little bit naive and tried to keep my team using Trello, but I very quickly realized that it is a losing battle. You’ve just got to go with it and there’s no other solution, basically, on the market. And so we ended up going with Jira. But it just stayed with me as this nagging feeling of disappointment. Separately, Karri at Airbnb had created a Chrome extension to re-skin their Jira, and Tuomas was building developer tools at Uber, using Fabricator. We all had similar experiences of ‘This doesn’t feel right and we should do something about it.’” — Jori Lallo, co-founderPersona’s founder noticed how inadequate identity tooling was when having to build this technology at Square:“I worked on identity over at Square for a fair bit of time. We actually used to joke as a collective team over on Square, ‘I’m sure in 10 years there will be someone who does this well for us.’ Importantly, while we were building it, we noticed that there was this disconnect between existing identity vendors thinking that there was going to be one technique that’ll solve all of a customers’ identity problems, while in reality, every business had a multi-modal approach: a bunch of different techniques to verify different people in different contexts. So we saw an opportunity to go after this problem in a unique way.” — Rick Song, co-founder and CEOHex’s founder realized that no one was going to build what he needed, so he had to do it himself:“I actually started this journey as a buyer. I was looking for something like Hex and I couldn’t find it. It took me a few months of going around and talking and asking people like, ‘Oh, what are you using for this? What are you using for that? Have you found anything good for this?’ Everyone said, ‘No, but if you do, let us know.’ It kind of clicked one day. I was like, ‘Well, maybe we should do this.’ I didn’t set out to be a founder. There are a lot of people out there who are like, ‘I want to be a founder. I just need an idea and a co-founder.’ I was almost the opposite. The idea was very obvious to me. I had two great co-founders that I had met at Palantir whom I loved working with. It almost took us a while to be like, ‘All right. I guess we have to do this. Don’t we? No one else is doing this, while we have to do it.’” — Barry McCardel, co-founder of HexTakeaway questions to reflect on:What did you or others build at previous jobs that proved to be incredibly valuable to the company, or your teammates?What’s a tool you wish you had (and would have paid a lot of money for) at your previous companies?What internal products have you built again and again at past companies?A surprisingly large number of founders came up with their startup idea by doing something that’s often discouraged: sitting around and whiteboarding. As you’ll see below, there’s a wrong way of whiteboarding and a right way (i.e. ideating and building in a silo versus quickly talking to potential users to validate your idea). But most importantly, if you want to find a great idea, again, focus on finding a problem space with three traits: (1) it’s important, (2) it’s underserved, and (3) you’re excited about it. Ideally your idea is also rooted in some experience you’ve had in the space, but it doesn’t have to be.Figma’s founders narrowed their focus to two areas they saw potential in and then started tinkering with the one they were most excited about — design:“After we got the Thiel Fellowship, I called Evan [Wallace, co-founder] and said, ‘Hey, you know, we’ve got actual funding now: $100,000 over two years. Do you want to go do this thing for real?’When you’re starting a company, it’s really useful to ask the question: why now? It’s a really useful framework. It can be societal; maybe there’s some new cultural trend. Perhaps it’s regulatory; some law has been passed or repealed. I like the technological version. For us, we saw drones in 2012 and WebGL as a few technologies that were happening. Because of them, new possibilities were suddenly there.On the drone side, we didn’t get very far. Evan in particular was not that interested in doing hardware. He’s like, hardware sucks, run debug cycles are really long, and then we focused on WebGL instead.We were also excited about computational photography for a bit, but quickly realized that with photos, that ends up leading to a consumer sort of application. And the entire purpose of WebGL was to be in the browser. Why would you do anything in photo editing if you’re not on the phone? And so we felt like we were kind of building in the wrong place and then eventually sort of shifted our attention to design. I had been a design intern at Flipboard, and that kind of helped me realize what would be possible there.” — Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO, via Elad GilVanta’s Christina Cacioppo similarly narrowed down her thinking to two spaces that felt ripe for opportunity that she was excited about (security and collaboration), and kept talking to customers to find the biggest source of pain and pull:“Our first couple of ideas were just total garbage. There was a lot of whiteboarding. I think the failure mode in this part of the process with the whiteboard is that it’s just all so abstract. There were no customers or users. Back then, I tended to be a shiny-object person, so left to my own devices, my natural inclination was just to go find all the shiny objects on the surface. So I was, okay, no, don’t do that. Pick one or two spaces and go really deep. You’re not allowed to look at anything else. Not allowed.I chose (1) team collaboration tools, because I thought, I don’t know if I truly love this but I know it from my Dropbox days, and (2) security, because it seemed interesting and I wanted to learn it. They both seemed big and important, and interesting, and I had all kinds of security and compliance challenges at Dropbox. I also felt like I’d be happy learning about that space, and I also wanted to work with startups.Within collaboration, we were asking ourselves, ‘What are the macro trends and new technologies shaping the world?’ It’s late 2016, and so . . . voice! Team collaboration software is also emerging, and so the answer is B2B Alexa. At the whiteboard stage, it makes so much sense. And in reality, zero sense. We recognized that if you can do it on a whiteboard, someone has probably done it. There’s no $20 bills on the sidewalk.Also, when you’re changing context from B2B Alexa to other ideas like, I’m going to make a better wiki, to solving security, to whatever, you’re spreading yourself too thin and you’re not going deep enough to actually learn anything that someone else hasn’t.So within the security bucket, I started asking all the startups I knew about security, and they all looked at me really guiltily and said, ‘We don’t really do anything. We know we should, but we don’t.’ Everyone wanted to do security, but it was hard to prioritize until customers asked for it. So I started doing it for them scrappily and manually, and that led to what Vanta is today.When I tell founders this, sometimes they’re like, ‘Well, how did you know security was going to work?’ You don’t. If you know the answer to that, go for it. But it’s only obvious if you look back.” — Christina Cacioppo, founder and CEONotion started with the general idea of a no-code app builder and eventually (four years later!) noticed pull for a specific set of features:“Early Notion was basically a no-code website builder. Some of the videos actually exist in YouTube. It didn’t go anywhere for years. It was very unstable, the tech stack we had used in the early iterations of it was fairly buggy, and user feedback was not great. But as we peeled the onion, talking to users and using it ourselves, we realized that for the people that continued to use it, they liked some elements of the editor and the collaborative features that the product had. And through that, we realized that we should double down on docs and wiki.The turning point was in early 2017 (four years in), when we launched Notion 1.0, focused around just docs and wikis. At the same time, we made a few different templates ourselves so that you can click a button and start using the product. Instead of telling people to build software using our tool, you can now click a button and get this modern docs/wiki product, without any work. It proved to be a great wedge into the market, because notes is the simplest unit of work, and it got people in the door and using the product. And then once people actually started using it, some people went down to the lower stack and they were like, ‘Huh, I can actually change these things. I can modify it, I can build my own template.’ We took a little bit of a roundabout way of getting there, but that’s the story.” — Akshay Kothari, co-founder and COOFor Zip, Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng went through a variety of ideas, looking for a big and underserved market they were excited about. They eventually focused on procurement (and their company is currently valued at over $1B):“This was actually our sixth or seventh idea. Some earlier ideas included allowing people in India (and then other countries) to be able to buy U.S. equities in a fractional way, and an accounting staffing platform (which generated $200k of revenue!).Eventually, as we were thinking through our next pivot, the advice we got from our Y Combinator partner was to look for a market that was large and had entrenched companies that weren’t great. This led us to the procurement space.And then we thought back to this problem at Airbnb. In hindsight, we both adjacently ran into it a couple of times, but we didn’t realize it until later.” — Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng, co-foundersFor Databricks, Ali Ghodsi noticed a new technology emerging that was underutilized and kept talking to users until he realized how to turn it into a real company:“We were doing research for a bunch of years at U.C. Berkeley and had started seeing what was happening in Silicon Valley tech companies, how they were solving data scalability problems, and how different their approach was from what we were seeing in the rest of the industry. At that time, the rest of the industry was leveraging this technology called Hadoop, and that was the best thing since apple pie for them. But we were seeing that the Silicon Valley tech companies were using a different technology (what is now Apache Spark) and were in fact doing AI and machine learning on data, and they were getting magical results. We knew this technology could be game-changing for the rest of the industry. Our initial thought was, ‘Can we just take what we’re seeing over there, open source it, and publish the research, and then the whole world will adopt it and we’ve changed the world?’ We didn’t really intend to start a company. But then over the years, it was frustrating to see that we had found this software, and we had open-sourced it, and we thought it was so amazing, but it wasn’t getting the uptake that we thought it deserved. And people kept telling us, ‘This is some academic project. How do we know that we can really rely on it? Is it really enterprise-ready?’ And so on. There was frustration around 2012 where we thought, if we start something, if we ourselves get behind it and we raise some money, maybe we can really actually ourselves make it happen. So that was the journey.” — Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEOTakeaway questions to reflect on:What’s a trend that’s emerging but underserved (e.g. security, collaboration)?What’s a transformative technology that’s emerging that’s underutilized (e.g. data scalability)?How many potential customers have you spoken with about your idea?How important to potential customers is the problem you’re exploring, on a scale of 1 to 10?How underserved is the current market, on a scale of 1 to 10? And where would your solution rank? Look for a delta of at least 4.A final path is simply to keep building what you’re building, but pay special attention to features or functionality that are showing strong pull from existing users. This may lead to shifting your approach slightly, or it may lead to a completely different product.In the case of Amplitude, the big idea came from noticing other founders wanting access to their internal analytics tool:“We started with a different company before Amplitude, called Sonalight, which was a voice recognition application that allowed you to send and receive text messages by talking to your phone. One of the things that was really clear to us at the time was that you should look at what people are doing in your product in order to figure out how to make it better. Figure out where people are getting stuck, what keeps them coming back, what they like to use, and what they don’t like to use. We tried out tons of products on the market. I remember Flurry, Google Analytics, Adobe, Kissmetrics, and others. And none of them were able to answer the questions I just posed. And so we said, ‘All right, well, we’ve got to build it ourselves.’ A bunch of engineers with a lot of hubris, haha. So we ended up doing that. And as we shared those insights with other companies that we knew (we were at Y Combinator at the time), they were like, ‘Wow, that’s amazing. I really need to understand that about my business.’” — Spenser Skates, co-founder and CEOSprig followed a very similar story — Ryan Glasgow was building one product, but then noticed a side project seeing much more pull:“​​I was exploring a startup idea, but I wasn’t quite getting the pull I expected. I went back to what I knew, which is product management, and I started asking users tough questions, like ‘Would you pay for this?’ and ‘Why do you not use this?’ In this discovery process, I wanted to add more rigor, knowing that this was a high-stakes decision (e.g. I’d be spending 10-plus years of my life on it), and I found a technique called outcome-driven innovation, which adds rigor to product innovation. I was like, ‘Wow, this is mind-blowing. What if I could build a tool to help other people go through the idea maze and not build something before they de-risk the idea?’So I built a little SDK that people could plug into their apps, with a very simple front end, that would just rotate through three questions about functionality, usability, and quality (the core questions in the framework I mentioned). It used Airtable as the back end, actually; it was so simple. I shared this with other founders that I knew who were also trying to get their business off the ground, and gave them this spreadsheet of quality, usability, functionality, using this framework. And they were like, ‘Wow, I’m learning so much. I’d be your first customer if this was a product.’ It immediately clicked. They would say, ‘I’ll pay you for this.’ ​This was the market pull I was looking for, and I quickly pivoted to surveys.” — Ryan Glasgow, co-founder of SprigThe Loom founders went through two completely different products before seeing obvious pull within one unexpected feature of their app:“Loom was the result of two previously failed attempts in the video space. Our first was a marketplace for companies to hire subject-matter experts (i.e. product managers, designers, engineers, etc.) for feedback on checkout flows, UX, sales funnel, onboarding, and more. While we saw initial revenue here, this failed to get the traction to warrant additional build time (we were already four months in at this point). The second was a SaaS tool that any company can embed on their website and get instant feedback from their users in the form of a user test. Similar to the first iteration, this failed to get any real momentum after three months, although it led us to a remarkable insight from one of our few design partners.Three months into this second idea, we had an aha moment when a client used the product to record a video of himself summarizing all of the user tests his team had collected. That’s when it occurred to us that there could be something here.A month later, we launched on Product Hunt and had thousands of people who’d downloaded the extension by day’s end. That made it clear to us that we should double down on this new direction, and we’ve never looked back.” — Shahed Khan, co-founderWith Segment, nothing was working for a year and a half, and while throwing ideas against the wall, one idea finally stuck:“We originally applied to YC with the idea for a university classroom lecture tool (we were college students at the time), and we built that out over the course of the summer. It failed because we aren’t good at identifying real problems, and we decided that one reason is that we didn’t understand our users.We spent about 15 months pivoting and building various analytics products to help better understand users. None of them really took off, and we keep chasing the next idea that will get us users. As a growth hack, my co-founder Ilya built a little library called Analytics.js. The idea was that users can use it as a ‘drop-in replacement’ for Mixpanel or Kissmetrics and send us the exact same data as you would to each of them via one library. Users didn’t care much about our tool, but they seemed to like the idea of Analytics.js.Finally, we have about six months of runway left and we haven’t launched anything. My co-founder Ian [Storm Taylor] thinks that the idea behind Analytics.js could actually be a big deal. We could effectively be the ‘API layer’ over all these annoying and similar, but inconsistent, data tools.We’re split on the decision. Peter thinks it’s the worst idea he’s ever heard and that there’s zero chance a company could be made from 100 lines of JavaScript. We all agreed to build it for a week and launch it on Hacker News. That day, it goes straight to the top of HN, and the rest is history.” — Calvin French-Owen, co-founder of SegmentAnd famously, for Slack, the big idea came from noticing one feature being incredibly popular within their ill-fated video game:“We came to the conclusion that Glitch [the game he was working on] was never going to be the kind of business that would have justified the $17.2 million in venture capital investment [that we raised]. It might have been a neat project for a half-dozen people if we had spent a million dollars to get there, but by the end of 2012, there were 45 people working on it, we had spent many millions of dollars, and it just wasn’t ever going to scale. So we decided to shut it down without knowing what we were going to do next.The company still had millions of dollars left in the bank, and one of the possibilities was to return that money to the shareholders and call it a day, maybe start something else up. But because we had that money, we had the flexibility to shut it down in what we felt like was a humane way. We spent a long time working on reference letters for the employees who built the website, essentially to make sure that they all got jobs.We also gave users the choice to get a refund for everything they had spent, to let us keep the money, or donate it to charity. We kind of had our hands full for a little while in shutting the game down, and while we did that, we were thinking about what we might want to do next. There were all kinds of ideas.It took us a little while to settle on the idea that would become Slack.That was really born out of the style of communication that developed while we were working on the game. We used an older technology called IRC, and because IRC is very limited, over the years we added the little features here and there that we wanted.For example, in IRC, if you’re not online at the same time as me, I can’t send you a message. I have to wait until you are also connected. So one of the first things we did was build a way of archiving messages so that you could catch up when you came back online, and in those archives we wanted to be able to search them, so we added search, and so on. There was no good iPhone client, so we made an HTML5 front end for our archive viewer. This interesting dynamic happened. By the time we shut down the game, again there were 45 people at the company, we had been in operation for three and a half years, and we had a companywide email list. After more than three years, it only had 50 messages on it, so about one every three weeks. That wasn’t a deliberate decision, that wasn’t ideologically driven. But it just happened that everyone paid attention to IRC, and the more people paid attention to it, the more information we routed to it; and the more information we routed to it, the more people paid attention to it. So eventually, everything from database alerts to daily sales figures were being pumped into IRC. Every time someone uploaded a file to the file server, that would be posted into IRC. While we weren’t successful in making the game, we were very efficient in being unsuccessful to make the game.” — Stewart Butterfield, founder, via Business InsiderTakeaway questions to reflect on:Of all the things you’ve built, what one feature is showing the most pull?What problem are you currently facing with your startup that you wish someone would solve? Explore solving it yourself.What’s a side project you’ve been wanting to build that you haven’t?Look for ideas that are (1) important, (2) underserved, and (3) you’re excited to solve.Pick one of these routes and ask yourself these questions:Past painWhat did you or others build at previous jobs that proved to be incredibly valuable to the company or your teammates?What’s a tool you wish you had (and would have paid a lot of money for) at your previous companies?What internal products have you built again and again at past companies?Ponder and probeWhat’s a trend that’s emerging but underserved (e.g. security, collaboration)?What’s a transformative technology that’s emerging that’s underutilized (e.g. data scalability)?How many potential customers have you spoken with about your idea?How important to potential customers is the problem you’re exploring, on a scale of 1 to 10?How underserved is the current market, on a scale of 1 to 10?

Explore solving it yourself.What’s a side project you’ve been wanting to build that you haven’t?You know you’re on to something when you notice pull and pain.Now that you have a framework for coming up with an idea, the next step is to figure out if the idea is worth going all-in on.Have a fulfilling and productive week 🙏Snyk’s Guy Podjarny noticed a couple of emerging trends and pain points in two previous jobs and began tinkering with the idea:“Between 2002 and 2010, I helped build and manage some of the very first Application Security (AppSec) products, which customers used to find and fix AppSec vulnerabilities. Since it was very expensive to fix flaws you found at the end of a year-long release cycle, we tried to get security to ‘shift left’ — to find issues during development where it’s cheaper to fix them.I left that path to found my first startup, Blaze, building a real-time web page compiler that made websites faster. Blaze was acquired by Akamai, where I became the CTO of the web performance business. DevOps played a key role in that journey, and the perspective helped me appreciate the impact it will have on the industry — and the opportunities it brings. These two lenses made me realize two things:At the pace of DevOps, getting developers to embrace security has gone from an efficiency and costs play to a necessity. It’s the only way for software to be secure.If you build the right solution, developers can and will embrace security. DevOps had proven that by getting developers to embrace ops, with tools like New Relic, Heroku, and others paving the way.So after leaving Akamai, I set out to build a developer tooling company that tackled security.” — Guy Podjarny, founder and CEOAll three of Canva’s founders noticed a gap in the design space:“Mel [Melanie Perkins, co-founder and CEO] was teaching design through university, including how to use different types of design software, and through that experience, she realized that it was quite complicated and really hard for people with no design background to start approaching these tools and actually get something useful out of them.And I’d created a lot of creative tools over the previous decade, which I found unlocked people’s creativity in a whole bunch of different ways, like with music and drawing, and other creative tools. I’d worked at Google on a product called Google Wave, which was all about communication and collaboration, and again, being able to unlock people’s creativity through new technology and new experiences.When I met Mel and Cliff [Obrecht, co-founder and COO] in 2012, the idea of unlocking design and creativity really captured all of our imaginations, and so we decided to band together in July 2012 and start building that first product. We eventually launched Canva in August 2013, about a year later.” — Cameron Adams, co-founder and CPOSame story for Stytch:“We had a monthly coffee chat on our calendar after Julianna [Lamb, co-founder] left Plaid to go to Very Good Security. We were always just catching up and often complaining about work, what we were banging our heads against the wall on. And that week, we were both banging our head against the wall on authentication. It was the number one thing I worked on at Plaid. And so I was particularly frustrated. And then Julianna had just finished a project to rip out Auth0. A project had gone on for six months before she joined, and then it was taking so long that they’d stopped doing it and then later picked it up again. It was like a meme within the company because of how annoying a project it was and how much time it was taking. Julianna was talking about how frustrating it was internally there, I was talking about how we just had a really bad experience with Auth0 and AWS Cognito at Plaid. And we were just surprised that everything assumed you’re using a password in terms of how the APIs were designed, but also, you didn’t have much flexibility.And so that was the first time we were both complaining about the same thing, which led it to being the first company idea where I think what we said was: we just presumed there would’ve been a Stripe for authentication in terms of how easy it was to work with an API, to do this rip and replace Julianna was doing or add the password-less features that we were trying to add in the Plaid.So December 2019 was the coffee. We had left our jobs at Plaid and Very Good Security at end of April, early May, I want to say, to go full-time on this. And we raised our seed round in June of 2020.” — Reed McGinley-Stempel, co-founderThe founders of Snowflake noticed looming challenges with companies relying on Hadoop:“In 2012, Thierry Cruanes and I were working at Oracle, and there was not a single day without discussions on how Hadoop [a developer of open-source computer software] was about to make [our work] completely obsolete. I even remember one day interviewing a young engineer who [was] so excited about Hadoop that he didn’t listen to anything we said about Oracle. We realized then that we were missing something.This made us think a lot about the future [of what we were doing]. Big data was taking over the world, and data warehouses as we knew them were having a really hard time competing. They were — and often still are — rigid, expensive, and difficult to use. At the same time, we were convinced that Hadoop was not a good solution either. Hadoop systems were really too hard to use for most — very inefficient, slow, and missing key features that I would consider must-haves.This is the point we realized we could [build] a new type of data warehouse system . . . that would master the elasticity of the cloud. [What we built ran] 10 times faster than any other system for the same cost [and freed] users from any management tasks.” — Benoit Dageville, co-founder, via Yahoo FinanceRamp’s founders found that credit card companies were solving the wrong problem, through working at Capital One and their previous startup:“Ramp is a continuation of a lot of things we’ve been working on for a while. I had a company before this called Paribus, which helped people save money on things they were buying online. Within the year, we had about a million customers. Then we got what was a life-changing offer from Capital One to buy the company and went for it. So that was about 2016.We then spent the next two and a half years there scaling the company. We learned a lot more about how to turn data into savings at scale, and about all the ways that you can use fragments of data processes to automate processes, save people money, and save people time in various ways.We also ended up in the credit card division within Capital One, where we learned about how credit cards work, how rewards work, and all that. I just remember we talked to customers and asked them, ‘Did you want points, cash back, something different for rewards?’ And what jumped out is people didn’t really want any of that. They wanted to be better-off. And we were just struck by this idea of rewards versus not spending that dollar in that first place.Pretty quickly we got obsessed with an idea: what if your card was smart enough to help you spend less? It actually might be better for the customer. You might be able to have a better shot at breaking out of the price-based competition.And fintech was becoming a thing then, where you could actually start these businesses relatively cheaply.There was only so much we could do inside of Capital One, and we helped what was Capital One Shopping become a thing and grow, and now it’s a big part of what they do, but we also concluded we couldn’t quite do what we were hoping to do inside of the company. So we left and then set out to build Ramp. That’s the story.” — Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEOCoda’s Shishir Mehrotra had been thinking about this idea for years:“Coda started as a series of brainstorms. And at the time, I was reasonably happy at Google. I wasn’t going anywhere. But I had this long list of ideas of just stuff I’d like to see different in the world. This idea is one that’s been on my list for 20-plus years. And in some way or the other, I’ve actually worked on it three different times.I had a good friend, Alex [DeNeui, eventual Coda co-founder], who was busy starting a company and had decided to pivot to a new idea. He asked me for help brainstorming what he should work on, and we ended up talking about the core ideas behind Coda — that the line between docs and apps is artificial, and that it was time for a new blinking cursor. And in that process, I ended up basically falling in love with the idea again myself. Despite all reasonable indicators of why you shouldn’t start a company, I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. And so I jumped in, and it was kind of funny, when I was talking to my wife: we were driving up to Napa for this wedding, and we’re in the car, and I was like, ‘I think I’m going to do this company with Alex.’ And she says, ‘Yeah, I already knew that.’ And I said, ‘How?’ And she’s like, ‘Because you took every free moment and you’re spending all that time with him on this idea.’” — Shishir Mehrotra, co-founder and CEOGusto’s three founders had secondhand experience with the challenges of running a small business and after ideating, focused on payroll as a great place to start:“My parents have a clothing store. It’s a small business, and I just grew up there in the store every day after school, going and organizing and selling and answering the phone calls and helping in the store. So I have this kind of small-business experience throughout my family. My grandfather has another store down the street. My aunt had another store. All in the same street in Haifa. So I really grew up around these small businesses, and one thing that’s really, really, really clear is that they don’t have the tools that big companies have in order to be successful. If you think about it, they are the ones who actually need the tools more than anyone else.So this idea of, what can you do to help this underserved group who need the help and what can you do to level the playing field for small business, is something that was always top of mind for me. Josh [Reeves], Eddie [Kim], and I [co-founders] all share a similar story with small businesses in our families. So when we got together, we wanted to build something.We kicked around a bunch of ideas for a couple of months. We had this massive whiteboard, and we kind of plotted a lot of different problems that we felt ourselves personally in our lives in different moments and different things, but very quickly we got focused on small businesses and then started talking with people. We learned that a third of companies make payroll mistakes every year, and they get fines for it every year. That’s insane. The system is incredibly broken, so that’s where the idea came from.” — Tomer London, co-founder and CPOFor Census, Boris Jabes noticed a big pain point at his previous job and couldn’t stop thinking about it:“Where the idea came from (eventually): I sold my previous startup (Meldium) to a company called LogMeIn, and I ended up working with a bunch of sales and marketing people there. Working with them was a struggle because they didn’t seem to have the same fountain of usage data that we did on the product and engineering side. That planted a seed in my mind. I thought, ‘There really should just be one version of who is your user, what did they do, and what do we know about them?’ My brain kept coming back to it, and my co-founders found it intriguing as well. But who was it for? In what form? That part was super-vague.We started to get together in the metaphorical basement, which was my house some days and my co-founder Anton [Vaynshtok]’s house other days. We kept asking, ‘What’s something that is customer data- or CRM-related?’ For a couple of months, we worked on ideas in the domain, even going as far as building the prototype of a CRM for marketplaces.We realized it was better for us to say, ‘All right, marketplace CRM, let’s do this.’ We did it for two months. We didn’t want to raise on this right away. Instead let’s see if there ‘is a there there.’ We were looking for the combo of something we liked and excited potential users before building in earnest. A sensation that there’s a big problem that I would be willing to spend the next decade of my life pursuing.Looking back, sitting in a room and trying to come up with a great startup is really bad. We played that exercise for a month, and it’s just bad because we should have been talking to people who had problems. What I realized was all our ideas sounded great, but they were not connected to a specific user pain. For us, writing code, even though it’s not the most efficient use of time, helped us explore ideas best. Maybe we did it in a less efficient way; it forced us to talk to people and build a mental model of the real world.” — Boris Jabes, co-founder of CensusIf you’re hiring, join Lenny’s Talent Collective to start getting weekly drops of world-class product and growth people who are passively open to new opportunities.

Over the next two months, I’m going to share a multi-party in-depth playbook for kickstarting and scaling a B2B business. This series took hundreds of hours of work and is based on dozens of 1:1 interviews with the founders of two dozen of today’s most successful B2B companies — including Gong, Notion, Figma, Amplitude, Retool, Canva, and many more. In addition to these juggernauts, I’ve also pulled in a handful of my favorite up-and-coming B2B startups, including Linear, Vanta, Stytch, Zip, Census, Persona, and Hex.\n\nThis series builds on my two previous playbooks — for consumer businesses and marketplace businesses — and brings me one step closer to my goal of giving every founder a tactical guide for turning their idea into reality. Even if you’re not building a B2B startup right now, you’ll find inspiration, new ideas, and frameworks that will help you with the product you’re building right now. Here is what’s in store:\n\nPart 1: How to come up with a great B2B startup idea ← This post\n\nPart 2: How to validate your idea\n\nPart 3: How to identify your ICP\n\nPart 4: How to find and win your first 10 customers\n\nPart 5: How to find product-market fit\n\nPart 6: How, and when, to hire your early team\n\nPart 7: How to scale your growth engine\n\nYou’ll find never-before-shared stories, surprising lessons, and, as usual — a ton of tactical and actionable advice you can use to grow your own product today.\n\nHere’s a peek at a few of the more surprising takeaways:\n\nThe majority of founders had no special skill or background in the problem space they went after.\n\nMost B2B startup ideas did not come from the founder feeling the pain at their last gig (though many did).\n\nEvery prosumer product (e.g. Notion, Figma, Airtable, Miro, Slack, Coda) took two to four years of wandering in the dark before they found something that worked.\n\nFounders spoke to a median of 30 potential customers to validate their idea before committing.\n\n~40% of startups pivoted at least once before landing on their winning idea — oftentimes more than once.\n\nAbout 20% were solo founders.\n\nCold outbound works — it’s the second most common way to get your early customers.\n\nThis series should probably be a book, but instead I’m sharing it with you all here. I’m excited to hear what you think and evolve this work further. And remember: following these steps (or any steps!) won’t guarantee success. But it’ll certainly improve your odds. Let’s get started with step one: coming up with a great idea.\n\nA huge thank-you to Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Ali Ghodsi (CEO of Databricks), Barry McCardel (CEO of Hex), Boris Jabes (CEO of Census), Calvin French-Owen (co-founder of Segment), Cameron Adams (co-founder and CPO of Canva), Christina Cacioppo (CEO of Vanta), David Hsu (CEO of Retool), Eilon Reshef (CPO of Gong), Eric Glyman (CEO of Ramp), Guy Podjarny (CEO of Snyk), Jori Lallo (co-founder of Linear), Julianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel (co-founders of Stytch), Mathilde Collin (CEO of Front), Rick Song (CEO of Persona), Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng (co-founders of Zip), Ryan Glasgow (CEO of Sprig), Shahed Khan (co-founder of Loom), Shishir Mehrotra (CEO of Coda), Sho Kuwamoto (VP of Product of Figma), Spenser Skates (co-founder and CEO of Amplitude), and Tomer London (co-founder and CPO of Gusto) for contributing to this series. Art by Natalie Harney.\n\nIf you boil it down, there are essentially three elements to a great B2B startup idea:\n\nThere need to be a lot of people willing to spend a lot of money to solve the problem. Most startups fail not because the idea isn’t good but because the market for the solution is just too small. If you want to build a venture-scale business, a rule of thumb is that there needs to be a clear path to $100m in revenue per year, and eventually a path to $1B a year. Here’s a great example of what you want to see, as told by Ryan Glasgow, CEO of Sprig:\n\n“Robinhood agreed to a large contract even though we were early. They’re like, ‘We love it. We’ll install tomorrow.’ They installed it as we were building the first version.”\n\nHunter Walk has a great framework called LUV. Also, here’s my take on what makes a venture-scale idea, and a guide to help you think through your market size.\n\nExisting solutions need to be doing a subpar job of solving the problem. The founder of CRED, Kunal Shah, has a great framework for evaluating potential new solutions, called Delta-4:\n\nWhat would a customer rate the existing solution on a scale of 1 to 10?\n\nWhat would they rate your solution?\n\nYour solution needs to be +4 better for anyone to care about your product.\n\nThis also means that if the existing solution gets a 6 or higher, it’ll be very hard to replace (e.g. Excel). Here’s what you’d love to see, as shared by Tomer London, co-founder of Gusto:\n\n“As soon as we asked them the simple question of how they feel about their current payroll provider, they started cursing. More than half of the people we talked to just started cursing, unprompted. Two people voluntarily told me, ‘I use [competitor name], and my password is fuck[competitor name].’”\n\nFinally, the problem needs to be something you are willing to spend many years of your life solving. This advice from Dylan Field, co-founder of Figma, captures the sentiment perfectly:\n\n“There are actually a lot of good ideas out there. It’s kind of the weird part, especially if you’re searching for one; it feels like it’s not the case, but there are so many different markets that are underserved. The more important thing, actually, is to find something that you are personally passionate about, because any good company takes a long time to build.If you are, let’s say, three to four years in on an idea that you hate, you’re just going to burn out and you’re going to quit. It won’t feel good and you’ll be hating life. Don’t just go for an idea because it’s kind of working. Go for an idea that you really care about, because even if it doesn’t work, you’ll still learn from it and you’ll still have one.” — Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, via Elad Gil\n\nIf you are, let’s say, three to four years in on an idea that you hate, you’re just going to burn out and you’re going to quit.

Go for an idea that you really care about, because even if it doesn’t work, you’ll still learn from it and you’ll still have one.” — Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, via Elad Gil\n\nTakeaway: Find an idea that solves a problem that is important, underserved, and that you’re excited about. You’ll hear a lot more about how to do this, and what this looks and feels like, below.\n\n“It’s essential to work on something you’re deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.” — Paul Graham\n\nAcross all of the interviews I did, I found three reliable paths for discovering a great idea:\n\nPast pain: Identify a large pain you experienced at a previous company — then build a solution.\n\nPonder and probe: Pick a space you’re interested in, then whiteboard and tinker while talking to dozens of potential customers — looking intently for pain and pull.\n\nPresent pull: Identify something you’ve built that is showing signs of pull — and pivot fully to that.\n\nHere’s an overview of how today’s biggest B2B companies found their ideas:\n\nNo matter which path you take, you are looking for two things: pain and pull. Pain tells you there’s an opportunity to solve a problem, and that it’s important. Pull tells you that you’re actually solving the problem.\n\nLet’s explore each of the three paths, illustrated by founder stories.\n\nWhen I first started this research, I was expecting this path to be the way that all great startups found their ideas. Surprisingly, it only accounts for about 40% of great ideas.\n\nLet’s consider five successful startups that found their big idea following the path of past pain: Gong, Retool, Linear, Persona, and Hex.\n\nThe CEO of Gong experienced the pain of being unable to understand what was going wrong within the sales process at his previous company:\n\n“Amit, now my co-founder, ran a company in the BI space called Sisense. He ran into a problem — when sales didn’t work well — and it was very hard to understand why. He realized that essentially all of the knowledge about what was working and not working was hidden inside people’s heads: ‘The CRM was showing me stuff, but it wasn’t anything meaningful. Yes, you didn’t close that deal, but why?’He left Sisense and looked around to see if anybody was addressing this problem. I was on sabbatical doing nothing, learning deep learning, so we figured: let’s try to come up with a system that takes the stuff from salespeople’s heads, captures the information, and gives visibility and guidance to the rest of the organization.” — Eilon Reshef, co-founder and CPO\n\nHe left Sisense and looked around to see if anybody was addressing this problem. I was on sabbatical doing nothing, learning deep learning, so we figured: let’s try to come up with a system that takes the stuff from salespeople’s heads, captures the information, and gives visibility and guidance to the rest of the organization.”\n\n— Eilon Reshef, co-founder and CPO\n\nDavid Hsu, the founder of Retool, found himself building the same product over and over at each company he worked at:\n\n“Perhaps a little-known fact is that I had actually started a couple of other companies and products before Retool. And every time the team built any of these products, we had to go build our own tools for it. Eventually, when you build enough of the same things — in this instance, internal tools for different projects — you kind of realize they actually all have the same building blocks. We thought, ‘There’s got to be a better way of doing this.’ And we’re lazy engineers and we thought other engineers would be lazy as well. So that’s how the idea [for Retool] first came about.” — David Hsu, founder and CEO\n\n— David Hsu, founder and CEO\n\nThe founders of Linear felt deeply disappointed every time their companies defaulted to Jira:\n\n“Linear emerged out of the pain we all felt with issue tracking project management, when it comes to building software. I was at the time at Coinbase, Karri [Saarinen, co-founder] was at Airbnb, Tuomas [Artman, co-founder] was at Uber. We were all at these growth-stage companies and saw how they both grow and operated as they grew.I very vividly remember the time around 2016 at Coinbase, when we were closing in on 100 people and we hired a VP of engineering. There was a desire to start unifying the teams using a single tool. And Jira started coming up in the conversations.I was maybe a little bit naive and tried to keep my team using Trello, but I very quickly realized that it is a losing battle. You’ve just got to go with it and there’s no other solution, basically, on the market. And so we ended up going with Jira. But it just stayed with me as this nagging feeling of disappointment. Separately, Karri at Airbnb had created a Chrome extension to re-skin their Jira, and Tuomas was building developer tools at Uber, using Fabricator. We all had similar experiences of ‘This doesn’t feel right and we should do something about it.’” — Jori Lallo, co-founder\n\nI very vividly remember the time around 2016 at Coinbase, when we were closing in on 100 people and we hired a VP of engineering.

We actually used to joke as a collective team over on Square, ‘I’m sure in 10 years there will be someone who does this well for us.’ Importantly, while we were building it, we noticed that there was this disconnect between existing identity vendors thinking that there was going to be one technique that’ll solve all of a customers’ identity problems, while in reality, every business had a multi-modal approach: a bunch of different techniques to verify different people in different contexts. So we saw an opportunity to go after this problem in a unique way.” — Rick Song, co-founder and CEO\n\n— Rick Song, co-founder and CEO\n\nHex’s founder realized that no one was going to build what he needed, so he had to do it himself:\n\n“I actually started this journey as a buyer. I was looking for something like Hex and I couldn’t find it. It took me a few months of going around and talking and asking people like, ‘Oh, what are you using for this? What are you using for that? Have you found anything good for this?’ Everyone said, ‘No, but if you do, let us know.’ It kind of clicked one day. I was like, ‘Well, maybe we should do this.’ I didn’t set out to be a founder. There are a lot of people out there who are like, ‘I want to be a founder. I just need an idea and a co-founder.’ I was almost the opposite. The idea was very obvious to me. I had two great co-founders that I had met at Palantir whom I loved working with. It almost took us a while to be like, ‘All right. I guess we have to do this. Don’t we? No one else is doing this, while we have to do it.’” — Barry McCardel, co-founder of Hex\n\nI didn’t set out to be a founder.

As you’ll see below, there’s a wrong way of whiteboarding and a right way (i.e. ideating and building in a silo versus quickly talking to potential users to validate your idea). But most importantly, if you want to find a great idea, again, focus on finding a problem space with three traits: (1) it’s important, (2) it’s underserved, and (3) you’re excited about it. Ideally your idea is also rooted in some experience you’ve had in the space, but it doesn’t have to be.\n\nFigma’s founders narrowed their focus to two areas they saw potential in and then started tinkering with the one they were most excited about — design:\n\n“After we got the Thiel Fellowship, I called Evan [Wallace, co-founder] and said, ‘Hey, you know, we’ve got actual funding now: $100,000 over two years. Do you want to go do this thing for real?’When you’re starting a company, it’s really useful to ask the question: why now? It’s a really useful framework. It can be societal; maybe there’s some new cultural trend. Perhaps it’s regulatory; some law has been passed or repealed. I like the technological version. For us, we saw drones in 2012 and WebGL as a few technologies that were happening. Because of them, new possibilities were suddenly there.On the drone side, we didn’t get very far. Evan in particular was not that interested in doing hardware. He’s like, hardware sucks, run debug cycles are really long, and then we focused on WebGL instead.We were also excited about computational photography for a bit, but quickly realized that with photos, that ends up leading to a consumer sort of application. And the entire purpose of WebGL was to be in the browser. Why would you do anything in photo editing if you’re not on the phone? And so we felt like we were kind of building in the wrong place and then eventually sort of shifted our attention to design. I had been a design intern at Flipboard, and that kind of helped me realize what would be possible there.” — Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO, via Elad Gil\n\nWhen you’re starting a company, it’s really useful to ask the question: why now?

There was a lot of whiteboarding. I think the failure mode in this part of the process with the whiteboard is that it’s just all so abstract. There were no customers or users. Back then, I tended to be a shiny-object person, so left to my own devices, my natural inclination was just to go find all the shiny objects on the surface. So I was, okay, no, don’t do that. Pick one or two spaces and go really deep. You’re not allowed to look at anything else. Not allowed.I chose (1) team collaboration tools, because I thought, I don’t know if I truly love this but I know it from my Dropbox days, and (2) security, because it seemed interesting and I wanted to learn it. They both seemed big and important, and interesting, and I had all kinds of security and compliance challenges at Dropbox. I also felt like I’d be happy learning about that space, and I also wanted to work with startups.Within collaboration, we were asking ourselves, ‘What are the macro trends and new technologies shaping the world?’ It’s late 2016, and so . . . voice! Team collaboration software is also emerging, and so the answer is B2B Alexa. At the whiteboard stage, it makes so much sense. And in reality, zero sense. We recognized that if you can do it on a whiteboard, someone has probably done it. There’s no $20 bills on the sidewalk.Also, when you’re changing context from B2B Alexa to other ideas like, I’m going to make a better wiki, to solving security, to whatever, you’re spreading yourself too thin and you’re not going deep enough to actually learn anything that someone else hasn’t.So within the security bucket, I started asking all the startups I knew about security, and they all looked at me really guiltily and said, ‘We don’t really do anything. We know we should, but we don’t.’ Everyone wanted to do security, but it was hard to prioritize until customers asked for it. So I started doing it for them scrappily and manually, and that led to what Vanta is today.When I tell founders this, sometimes they’re like, ‘Well, how did you know security was going to work?’ You don’t. If you know the answer to that, go for it. But it’s only obvious if you look back.” — Christina Cacioppo, founder and CEO\n\nBack then, I tended to be a shiny-object person, so left to my own devices, my natural inclination was just to go find all the shiny objects on the surface.

Some of the videos actually exist in YouTube. It didn’t go anywhere for years. It was very unstable, the tech stack we had used in the early iterations of it was fairly buggy, and user feedback was not great. But as we peeled the onion, talking to users and using it ourselves, we realized that for the people that continued to use it, they liked some elements of the editor and the collaborative features that the product had. And through that, we realized that we should double down on docs and wiki.The turning point was in early 2017 (four years in), when we launched Notion 1.0, focused around just docs and wikis. At the same time, we made a few different templates ourselves so that you can click a button and start using the product. Instead of telling people to build software using our tool, you can now click a button and get this modern docs/wiki product, without any work. It proved to be a great wedge into the market, because notes is the simplest unit of work, and it got people in the door and using the product. And then once people actually started using it, some people went down to the lower stack and they were like, ‘Huh, I can actually change these things. I can modify it, I can build my own template.’ We took a little bit of a roundabout way of getting there, but that’s the story.” — Akshay Kothari, co-founder and COO\n\nThe turning point was in early 2017 (four years in), when we launched Notion 1.0, focused around just docs and wikis. At the same time, we made a few different templates ourselves so that you can click a button and start using the product. Instead of telling people to build software using our tool, you can now click a button and get this modern docs/wiki product, without any work.

They eventually focused on procurement (and their company is currently valued at over $1B):\n\n“This was actually our sixth or seventh idea. Some earlier ideas included allowing people in India (and then other countries) to be able to buy U.S. equities in a fractional way, and an accounting staffing platform (which generated $200k of revenue!).Eventually, as we were thinking through our next pivot, the advice we got from our Y Combinator partner was to look for a market that was large and had entrenched companies that weren’t great. This led us to the procurement space.And then we thought back to this problem at Airbnb. In hindsight, we both adjacently ran into it a couple of times, but we didn’t realize it until later.” — Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng, co-founders\n\nEventually, as we were thinking through our next pivot, the advice we got from our Y Combinator partner was to look for a market that was large and had entrenched companies that weren’t great.

Berkeley and had started seeing what was happening in Silicon Valley tech companies, how they were solving data scalability problems, and how different their approach was from what we were seeing in the rest of the industry. At that time, the rest of the industry was leveraging this technology called Hadoop, and that was the best thing since apple pie for them. But we were seeing that the Silicon Valley tech companies were using a different technology (what is now Apache Spark) and were in fact doing AI and machine learning on data, and they were getting magical results. We knew this technology could be game-changing for the rest of the industry. Our initial thought was, ‘Can we just take what we’re seeing over there, open source it, and publish the research, and then the whole world will adopt it and we’ve changed the world?’ We didn’t really intend to start a company. But then over the years, it was frustrating to see that we had found this software, and we had open-sourced it, and we thought it was so amazing, but it wasn’t getting the uptake that we thought it deserved. And people kept telling us, ‘This is some academic project. How do we know that we can really rely on it? Is it really enterprise-ready?’ And so on. There was frustration around 2012 where we thought, if we start something, if we ourselves get behind it and we raise some money, maybe we can really actually ourselves make it happen. So that was the journey.” — Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO\n\nOur initial thought was, ‘Can we just take what we’re seeing over there, open source it, and publish the research, and then the whole world will adopt it and we’ve changed the world?’ We didn’t really intend to start a company.

And where would your solution rank? Look for a delta of at least 4.\n\nA final path is simply to keep building what you’re building, but pay special attention to features or functionality that are showing strong pull from existing users. This may lead to shifting your approach slightly, or it may lead to a completely different product.\n\nIn the case of Amplitude, the big idea came from noticing other founders wanting access to their internal analytics tool:\n\n“We started with a different company before Amplitude, called Sonalight, which was a voice recognition application that allowed you to send and receive text messages by talking to your phone. One of the things that was really clear to us at the time was that you should look at what people are doing in your product in order to figure out how to make it better. Figure out where people are getting stuck, what keeps them coming back, what they like to use, and what they don’t like to use. We tried out tons of products on the market. I remember Flurry, Google Analytics, Adobe, Kissmetrics, and others. And none of them were able to answer the questions I just posed. And so we said, ‘All right, well, we’ve got to build it ourselves.’ A bunch of engineers with a lot of hubris, haha. So we ended up doing that. And as we shared those insights with other companies that we knew (we were at Y Combinator at the time), they were like, ‘Wow, that’s amazing. I really need to understand that about my business.’” — Spenser Skates, co-founder and CEO\n\nWe tried out tons of products on the market.

I went back to what I knew, which is product management, and I started asking users tough questions, like ‘Would you pay for this?’ and ‘Why do you not use this?’ In this discovery process, I wanted to add more rigor, knowing that this was a high-stakes decision (e.g. I’d be spending 10-plus years of my life on it), and I found a technique called outcome-driven innovation, which adds rigor to product innovation. I was like, ‘Wow, this is mind-blowing. What if I could build a tool to help other people go through the idea maze and not build something before they de-risk the idea?’So I built a little SDK that people could plug into their apps, with a very simple front end, that would just rotate through three questions about functionality, usability, and quality (the core questions in the framework I mentioned). It used Airtable as the back end, actually; it was so simple. I shared this with other founders that I knew who were also trying to get their business off the ground, and gave them this spreadsheet of quality, usability, functionality, using this framework. And they were like, ‘Wow, I’m learning so much. I’d be your first customer if this was a product.’ It immediately clicked. They would say, ‘I’ll pay you for this.’ ​This was the market pull I was looking for, and I quickly pivoted to surveys.” — Ryan Glasgow, co-founder of Sprig\n\nSo I built a little SDK that people could plug into their apps, with a very simple front end, that would just rotate through three questions about functionality, usability, and quality (the core questions in the framework I mentioned).

Our first was a marketplace for companies to hire subject-matter experts (i.e. product managers, designers, engineers, etc.) for feedback on checkout flows, UX, sales funnel, onboarding, and more. While we saw initial revenue here, this failed to get the traction to warrant additional build time (we were already four months in at this point). The second was a SaaS tool that any company can embed on their website and get instant feedback from their users in the form of a user test. Similar to the first iteration, this failed to get any real momentum after three months, although it led us to a remarkable insight from one of our few design partners.Three months into this second idea, we had an aha moment when a client used the product to record a video of himself summarizing all of the user tests his team had collected. That’s when it occurred to us that there could be something here.A month later, we launched on Product Hunt and had thousands of people who’d downloaded the extension by day’s end. That made it clear to us that we should double down on this new direction, and we’ve never looked back.” — Shahed Khan, co-founder\n\nThree months into this second idea, we had an aha moment when a client used the product to record a video of himself summarizing all of the user tests his team had collected.

It failed because we aren’t good at identifying real problems, and we decided that one reason is that we didn’t understand our users.We spent about 15 months pivoting and building various analytics products to help better understand users. None of them really took off, and we keep chasing the next idea that will get us users. As a growth hack, my co-founder Ilya built a little library called Analytics.js. The idea was that users can use it as a ‘drop-in replacement’ for Mixpanel or Kissmetrics and send us the exact same data as you would to each of them via one library. Users didn’t care much about our tool, but they seemed to like the idea of Analytics.js.Finally, we have about six months of runway left and we haven’t launched anything. My co-founder Ian [Storm Taylor] thinks that the idea behind Analytics.js could actually be a big deal. We could effectively be the ‘API layer’ over all these annoying and similar, but inconsistent, data tools.We’re split on the decision. Peter thinks it’s the worst idea he’s ever heard and that there’s zero chance a company could be made from 100 lines of JavaScript. We all agreed to build it for a week and launch it on Hacker News. That day, it goes straight to the top of HN, and the rest is history.” — Calvin French-Owen, co-founder of Segment\n\nWe spent about 15 months pivoting and building various analytics products to help better understand users.

It might have been a neat project for a half-dozen people if we had spent a million dollars to get there, but by the end of 2012, there were 45 people working on it, we had spent many millions of dollars, and it just wasn’t ever going to scale. So we decided to shut it down without knowing what we were going to do next.The company still had millions of dollars left in the bank, and one of the possibilities was to return that money to the shareholders and call it a day, maybe start something else up. But because we had that money, we had the flexibility to shut it down in what we felt like was a humane way. We spent a long time working on reference letters for the employees who built the website, essentially to make sure that they all got jobs.We also gave users the choice to get a refund for everything they had spent, to let us keep the money, or donate it to charity. We kind of had our hands full for a little while in shutting the game down, and while we did that, we were thinking about what we might want to do next. There were all kinds of ideas.It took us a little while to settle on the idea that would become Slack.That was really born out of the style of communication that developed while we were working on the game. We used an older technology called IRC, and because IRC is very limited, over the years we added the little features here and there that we wanted.For example, in IRC, if you’re not online at the same time as me, I can’t send you a message. I have to wait until you are also connected. So one of the first things we did was build a way of archiving messages so that you could catch up when you came back online, and in those archives we wanted to be able to search them, so we added search, and so on. There was no good iPhone client, so we made an HTML5 front end for our archive viewer. This interesting dynamic happened. By the time we shut down the game, again there were 45 people at the company, we had been in operation for three and a half years, and we had a companywide email list. After more than three years, it only had 50 messages on it, so about one every three weeks. That wasn’t a deliberate decision, that wasn’t ideologically driven. But it just happened that everyone paid attention to IRC, and the more people paid attention to it, the more information we routed to it; and the more information we routed to it, the more people paid attention to it. So eventually, everything from database alerts to daily sales figures were being pumped into IRC. Every time someone uploaded a file to the file server, that would be posted into IRC. While we weren’t successful in making the game, we were very efficient in being unsuccessful to make the game.” — Stewart Butterfield, founder, via Business Insider\n\nThe company still had millions of dollars left in the bank, and one of the possibilities was to return that money to the shareholders and call it a day, maybe start something else up.

Since it was very expensive to fix flaws you found at the end of a year-long release cycle, we tried to get security to ‘shift left’ — to find issues during development where it’s cheaper to fix them.I left that path to found my first startup, Blaze, building a real-time web page compiler that made websites faster. Blaze was acquired by Akamai, where I became the CTO of the web performance business. DevOps played a key role in that journey, and the perspective helped me appreciate the impact it will have on the industry — and the opportunities it brings. These two lenses made me realize two things:At the pace of DevOps, getting developers to embrace security has gone from an efficiency and costs play to a necessity. It’s the only way for software to be secure.If you build the right solution, developers can and will embrace security. DevOps had proven that by getting developers to embrace ops, with tools like New Relic, Heroku, and others paving the way.So after leaving Akamai, I set out to build a developer tooling company that tackled security.” — Guy Podjarny, founder and CEO\n\nI left that path to found my first startup, Blaze, building a real-time web page compiler that made websites faster.

I’d worked at Google on a product called Google Wave, which was all about communication and collaboration, and again, being able to unlock people’s creativity through new technology and new experiences.When I met Mel and Cliff [Obrecht, co-founder and COO] in 2012, the idea of unlocking design and creativity really captured all of our imaginations, and so we decided to band together in July 2012 and start building that first product.

We were always just catching up and often complaining about work, what we were banging our heads against the wall on. And that week, we were both banging our head against the wall on authentication. It was the number one thing I worked on at Plaid. And so I was particularly frustrated. And then Julianna had just finished a project to rip out Auth0. A project had gone on for six months before she joined, and then it was taking so long that they’d stopped doing it and then later picked it up again. It was like a meme within the company because of how annoying a project it was and how much time it was taking. Julianna was talking about how frustrating it was internally there, I was talking about how we just had a really bad experience with Auth0 and AWS Cognito at Plaid. And we were just surprised that everything assumed you’re using a password in terms of how the APIs were designed, but also, you didn’t have much flexibility.And so that was the first time we were both complaining about the same thing, which led it to being the first company idea where I think what we said was: we just presumed there would’ve been a Stripe for authentication in terms of how easy it was to work with an API, to do this rip and replace Julianna was doing or add the password-less features that we were trying to add in the Plaid.So December 2019 was the coffee. We had left our jobs at Plaid and Very Good Security at end of April, early May, I want to say, to go full-time on this.

I even remember one day interviewing a young engineer who [was] so excited about Hadoop that he didn’t listen to anything we said about Oracle. We realized then that we were missing something.This made us think a lot about the future [of what we were doing]. Big data was taking over the world, and data warehouses as we knew them were having a really hard time competing. They were — and often still are — rigid, expensive, and difficult to use. At the same time, we were convinced that Hadoop was not a good solution either. Hadoop systems were really too hard to use for most — very inefficient, slow, and missing key features that I would consider must-haves.This is the point we realized we could [build] a new type of data warehouse system . . . that would master the elasticity of the cloud. [What we built ran] 10 times faster than any other system for the same cost [and freed] users from any management tasks.” — Benoit Dageville, co-founder, via Yahoo Finance\n\nThis made us think a lot about the future [of what we were doing].

I had a company before this called Paribus, which helped people save money on things they were buying online. Within the year, we had about a million customers. Then we got what was a life-changing offer from Capital One to buy the company and went for it. So that was about 2016.We then spent the next two and a half years there scaling the company. We learned a lot more about how to turn data into savings at scale, and about all the ways that you can use fragments of data processes to automate processes, save people money, and save people time in various ways.We also ended up in the credit card division within Capital One, where we learned about how credit cards work, how rewards work, and all that. I just remember we talked to customers and asked them, ‘Did you want points, cash back, something different for rewards?’ And what jumped out is people didn’t really want any of that. They wanted to be better-off. And we were just struck by this idea of rewards versus not spending that dollar in that first place.Pretty quickly we got obsessed with an idea: what if your card was smart enough to help you spend less? It actually might be better for the customer. You might be able to have a better shot at breaking out of the price-based competition.And fintech was becoming a thing then, where you could actually start these businesses relatively cheaply.There was only so much we could do inside of Capital One, and we helped what was Capital One Shopping become a thing and grow, and now it’s a big part of what they do, but we also concluded we couldn’t quite do what we were hoping to do inside of the company. So we left and then set out to build Ramp. That’s the story.” — Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEO\n\nWe then spent the next two and a half years there scaling the company. We learned a lot more about how to turn data into savings at scale, and about all the ways that you can use fragments of data processes to automate processes, save people money, and save people time in various ways.\n\nWe also ended up in the credit card division within Capital One, where we learned about how credit cards work, how rewards work, and all that. I just remember we talked to customers and asked them, ‘Did you want points, cash back, something different for rewards?’ And what jumped out is people didn’t really want any of that. They wanted to be better-off. And we were just struck by this idea of rewards versus not spending that dollar in that first place.\n\nPretty quickly we got obsessed with an idea: what if your card was smart enough to help you spend less? It actually might be better for the customer. You might be able to have a better shot at breaking out of the price-based competition.\n\nAnd fintech was becoming a thing then, where you could actually start these businesses relatively cheaply.\n\nThere was only so much we could do inside of Capital One, and we helped what was Capital One Shopping become a thing and grow, and now it’s a big part of what they do, but we also concluded we couldn’t quite do what we were hoping to do inside of the company.

That’s the story.”\n\n— Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEO\n\nCoda’s Shishir Mehrotra had been thinking about this idea for years:\n\n“Coda started as a series of brainstorms. And at the time, I was reasonably happy at Google. I wasn’t going anywhere. But I had this long list of ideas of just stuff I’d like to see different in the world. This idea is one that’s been on my list for 20-plus years. And in some way or the other, I’ve actually worked on it three different times.I had a good friend, Alex [DeNeui, eventual Coda co-founder], who was busy starting a company and had decided to pivot to a new idea. He asked me for help brainstorming what he should work on, and we ended up talking about the core ideas behind Coda — that the line between docs and apps is artificial, and that it was time for a new blinking cursor. And in that process, I ended up basically falling in love with the idea again myself. Despite all reasonable indicators of why you shouldn’t start a company, I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. And so I jumped in, and it was kind of funny, when I was talking to my wife: we were driving up to Napa for this wedding, and we’re in the car, and I was like, ‘I think I’m going to do this company with Alex.’ And she says, ‘Yeah, I already knew that.’ And I said, ‘How?’ And she’s like, ‘Because you took every free moment and you’re spending all that time with him on this idea.’” — Shishir Mehrotra, co-founder and CEO\n\nI had a good friend, Alex [DeNeui, eventual Coda co-founder], who was busy starting a company and had decided to pivot to a new idea.

It’s a small business, and I just grew up there in the store every day after school, going and organizing and selling and answering the phone calls and helping in the store. So I have this kind of small-business experience throughout my family. My grandfather has another store down the street. My aunt had another store. All in the same street in Haifa. So I really grew up around these small businesses, and one thing that’s really, really, really clear is that they don’t have the tools that big companies have in order to be successful. If you think about it, they are the ones who actually need the tools more than anyone else.So this idea of, what can you do to help this underserved group who need the help and what can you do to level the playing field for small business, is something that was always top of mind for me. Josh [Reeves], Eddie [Kim], and I [co-founders] all share a similar story with small businesses in our families. So when we got together, we wanted to build something.We kicked around a bunch of ideas for a couple of months. We had this massive whiteboard, and we kind of plotted a lot of different problems that we felt ourselves personally in our lives in different moments and different things, but very quickly we got focused on small businesses and then started talking with people. We learned that a third of companies make payroll mistakes every year, and they get fines for it every year. That’s insane. The system is incredibly broken, so that’s where the idea came from.” — Tomer London, co-founder and CPO\n\nSo this idea of, what can you do to help this underserved group who need the help and what can you do to level the playing field for small business, is something that was always top of mind for me.

Working with them was a struggle because they didn’t seem to have the same fountain of usage data that we did on the product and engineering side. That planted a seed in my mind. I thought, ‘There really should just be one version of who is your user, what did they do, and what do we know about them?’ My brain kept coming back to it, and my co-founders found it intriguing as well. But who was it for? In what form? That part was super-vague.We started to get together in the metaphorical basement, which was my house some days and my co-founder Anton [Vaynshtok]’s house other days. We kept asking, ‘What’s something that is customer data- or CRM-related?’ For a couple of months, we worked on ideas in the domain, even going as far as building the prototype of a CRM for marketplaces.We realized it was better for us to say, ‘All right, marketplace CRM, let’s do this.’ We did it for two months. We didn’t want to raise on this right away. Instead let’s see if there ‘is a there there.’ We were looking for the combo of something we liked and excited potential users before building in earnest. A sensation that there’s a big problem that I would be willing to spend the next decade of my life pursuing.Looking back, sitting in a room and trying to come up with a great startup is really bad. We played that exercise for a month, and it’s just bad because we should have been talking to people who had problems. What I realized was all our ideas sounded great, but they were not connected to a specific user pain. For us, writing code, even though it’s not the most efficient use of time, helped us explore ideas best. Maybe we did it in a less efficient way; it forced us to talk to people and build a mental model of the real world.” — Boris Jabes, co-founder of Census\n\nWe started to get together in the metaphorical basement, which was my house some days and my co-founder Anton [Vaynshtok]’s house other days.

In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online. But galleries didn't want to be online. It's not how the art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on this stupid idea? Because I didn't pay attention to users. I invented a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked from that. I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried to convince users to pay for what we'd built. Even then I took embarrassingly long to catch on. I was attached to my model of the world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software. They had to want it!Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.At YC we call these \"made-up\" or \"sitcom\" startup ideas. Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad.For example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn't sound obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. Surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users. You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features. [1]The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don't say \"I would never use this.\" They say \"Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.\" Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. [2] WellWhen a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making and whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well.Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic. There were only a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. Thirty years later Facebook had the same shape. Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users wanted it a lot.When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad. [3]You don't need the narrowness of the well per se. It's depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed). But you almost always do get it. In practice the link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition for a good startup idea, it's not a sufficient one. If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea. Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of. Colleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges. Once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting them in.Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other machines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems; applications; IPO. SelfHow do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea? How do you tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a niche product? Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb didn't realize at first how big a market they were tapping. Initially they had a much narrower idea. They were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions. They didn't foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually. All they knew at first is that they were onto something. That's probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.Occasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path out of the initial niche. And sometimes I can see a path that's not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at YC. But there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much experience you have. The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard to see.So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you're more likely to be right.In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig says: You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally. I've wondered about that passage since I read it in high school. I'm not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically, but it fits this situation well. Empirically, the way to have good startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.Being at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward. You can also be at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he used computers so much. If you'd asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they'd like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived online; to him it seemed natural.Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field \"live in the future.\" Combine that with Pirsig and you get: Live in the future, then build what's missing. That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas, it's generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind. Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think \"I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.\" Drew Houston realizes he's forgotten his USB stick and thinks \"I really need to make my files live online.\" Lots of people heard about the Altair. Lots forgot USB sticks. The reason those stimuli caused those founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented.The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not \"think up\" but \"notice.\" At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders' own experiences \"organic\" startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.That may not have been what you wanted to hear. You may have expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I'm telling you that the key is to have a mind that's prepared in the right way. But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth. And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend.If you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you're also looking for a cofounder. [4]You don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that's changing fast. Other domains change fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run.Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them. That's not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn't) but it's an advantage. It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking \"That's an interesting idea,\" you can think instead \"That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight.\" It's even better when you're both a programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head. NoticingOnce you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing. If you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are obviously missing. What won't be obvious is that they're startup ideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don't merely turn on the filter \"What's missing?\" Also turn off every other filter, particularly \"Could this be a big company?\" There's plenty of time to apply that test later. But if you're thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.Most things that are missing will take some time to see. You almost have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.But you know the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer. It's impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops. You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you think \"What did I do before x?\"And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted. Even the most radically open-minded of us mostly do that. You couldn't get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.But if you're looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to question things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you get a lot of email, or because it's hard to get email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much email? What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways to solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails around after you've read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that?Pay particular attention to things that chafe you. The advantage of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life (locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable. If you knew about all the things we'll get in the next 50 years but don't have yet, you'd find present day life pretty constraining, just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50 years in a time machine. When something annoys you, it could be because you're living in the future.When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as obvious, at least to you. When we started Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers making individual HTML pages. It was obvious to us as programmers that these sites would have to be generated by software. [5]Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious. That suggests how weird this process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet that you hadn't seen.Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the problem — i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas. The best plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be missing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies. [6]Give yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it. If Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month, what if they'd chosen a month before the Altair appeared? They probably would have worked on a less promising idea. Drew Houston did work on a less promising idea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup. But Dropbox was a much better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his skills. [7]A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something that already existed.Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as \"toys\" often produces good ones. When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter. But if you're living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft started working on them. I'm old enough to remember that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers was \"hobbyists.\" BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science project. The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another.At YC we're excited when we meet startups working on things that we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys. To us that's positive evidence an idea is good.If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can't afford not to), you can turn \"Live in the future and build what's missing\" into something even better: Live in the future and build what seems interesting. SchoolThat's what I'd advise college students to do, rather than trying to learn about \"entrepreneurship.\" \"Entrepreneurship\" is something you learn best by doing it. The examples of the most successful founders make that clear. What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future. College is an incomparable opportunity to do that. What a waste to sacrifice an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup — becoming the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas — by spending time learning about the easy part. Especially since you won't even really learn about it, any more than you'd learn about sex in a class. All you'll learn is the words for things.The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about some other field, you'll probably see problems that software could solve. In fact, you're doubly likely to find good problems in another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their problems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don't even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.So if you're a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead of taking a class on entrepreneurship you're better off taking a class on, say, genetics. Or better still, go work for a biotech company. CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software companies. But if you want to find startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field. [8]Or don't take any extra classes, and just build things. It's no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January. At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals. [9]But don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature optimization. Just build things. Preferably with other students. It's not just the classes that make a university such a good place to crank oneself into the future. You're also surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing. If you work together with them on projects, you'll end up producing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that, empirically, is the best combination.Beware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it's quite likely to represent a good startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup. [10] I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users' problems. Whereas when students (or professors) build something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward solving users' problems — perhaps even with an additional energy that comes from being freed from the constraints of research. CompetitionBecause a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll tend to feel that you're late. Don't let that deter you. Worrying that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle the question. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you're probably not too late. It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.If you're uncertain, ask users. The question of whether you're too late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs what you plan to make. If you have something that no competitor does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a beachhead. [11]The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more importantly, who's in it: if the beachhead consists of people doing something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it's probably big enough no matter how small it is. For example, if you're building something differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones, that's probably a big enough beachhead.Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.You don't need to worry about entering a \"crowded market\" so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that's a very promising starting point. Google was that type of idea. Your thesis has to be more precise than \"we're going to make an x that doesn't suck\" though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn't have the courage of their convictions, and that your plan is what they'd have done if they'd followed through on their own insights. Google was that type of idea too. The search engines that preceded them shied away from the most radical implications of what they were doing — particularly that the better a job they did, the faster users would leave.A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both that there's demand and that none of the existing solutions are good enough. A startup can't hope to enter a market that's obviously big and yet in which they have no competitors. So any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft). [12] FiltersThere are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay them lots of money. They'd prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world. Which is a reasonable preference, because such things slow you down. But this preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay about the condition it induces, which I called schlep blindness. I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is. Thousands of programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands of programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before Stripe. But when they looked for startup ideas they didn't see this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal with payments. And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe, but not an intolerable one. In fact they might have had net less pain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition. They didn't have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users, because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear. We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting things about the architecture of our software, but we weren't interested in ecommerce per se. We could see the problem was one that needed to be solved though.Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form of self-indulgence. Starting a successful startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what. Even if the product doesn't entail a lot of schleps, you'll still have plenty dealing with investors, hiring and firing people, and so on. So if there's some idea you think would be cool but you're kept away from by fear of the schleps involved, don't worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely useless as the schlep filter. If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing rapidly, your ideas about what's sexy will be somewhat correlated with what's valuable in practice. Particularly as you get older and more experienced. Plus if you find an idea sexy, you'll work on it more enthusiastically. [13] RecipesWhile the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them and then build whatever interests you, sometimes you don't have that luxury. Sometimes you need an idea now. For example, if you're working on a startup and your initial idea turns out to be bad.For the rest of this essay I'll talk about tricks for coming up with startup ideas on demand. Although empirically you're better off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You just have to be more disciplined. When you use the organic method, you don't even notice an idea unless it's evidence that something is truly missing. But when you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with self-discipline. You'll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad, so you need to be able to filter them.One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the example of the organic method. Organic ideas feel like inspirations. There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but \"just knew\" it was promising. When you feel that about an idea you've had while trying to come up with startup ideas, you're probably mistaken.When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise. If you're a database expert, don't build a chat app for teenagers (unless you're also a teenager). Maybe it's a good idea, but you can't trust your judgment about that, so ignore it. There have to be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can judge. Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving databases? That's because your expertise raises your standards. Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you're giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.The place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things you need. [14]One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying \"Why doesn't someone make x? If someone made x we'd buy it in a second.\" If you can think of any x people said that about, you probably have an idea. You know there's demand, and people don't say that about things that are impossible to build.More generally, try asking yourself whether there's something unusual about you that makes your needs different from most other people's. You're probably not the only one. It's especially good if you're different in a way people will increasingly be.If you're changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea you'd previously been working on. Did you discover any needs while working on it? Several well-known startups began this way. Hotmail began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. [15]A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young. Some of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their teens and early twenties. And while young founders are at a disadvantage in some respects, they're the only ones who really understand their peers. It would have been very hard for someone who wasn't a college student to start Facebook. So if you're a young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends would like to do that current technology won't let you?The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world. What's missing? What would they like to do that they can't? What's tedious or annoying, particularly in their work? Let the conversation get general; don't be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You're just looking for something to spark a thought. Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously realize they had, because you know how to solve it.When you find an unmet need that isn't your own, it may be somewhat blurry at first. The person who needs something may not know exactly what they need. In that case I often recommend that founders act like consultants — that they do what they'd do if they'd been retained to solve the problems of this one user. People's problems are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will be reusable, and whatever isn't will be a small price to start out certain that you've reached the bottom of the well. [16]One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems is to make them your own. When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn how restaurants worked. That may seem like taking things to extremes, but startups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps. Don't try to start Twitter. Those ideas are so rare that you can't find them by looking for them. Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries, it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their demise. For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment. But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism. What sort of company might cause people in the future to say \"this replaced journalism\" on some axis?But imagine asking that in the future, not now. When one company or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side. So don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs. Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has already started to be on most).When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore. It's particularly good if there's an admixture of disdain in the big players' attitude, because that often misleads them. For example, after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option to produce it. Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which seemed intolerably déclassé to a high-end hardware company like HP was at the time. [17]Are there groups of scruffy but sophisticated users like the early microcomputer \"hobbyists\" that are currently being ignored by the big players? A startup with its sights set on bigger things can often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that wouldn't be justified by that market alone.Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them. The prices of gene sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore's Law-like declines. What new things will we be able to do in the new world we'll have in a few years? What are we unconsciously ruling out as impossible that will soon be possible? OrganicBut talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas. Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method. If you're at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don't have to look for waves; you are the wave.Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most people who try fail so miserably. It doesn't work well simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible. The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination to build things just because they're interesting.Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that's the real recipe. Notes[1] This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web. It was common in the 1990s, except then people who had it used to say they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network for x. Structurally the idea is stone soup: you post a sign saying \"this is the place for people interested in x,\" and all those people show up and you make money from them. What lures founders into this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who might be interested in each type of x. What they forget is that any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard, and no one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.[2] I'm not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social network for pet owners is a bad idea. I know it's a bad idea the way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism. The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don't even sound that plausible. So if all you know about a startup idea is that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it's bad.[3] More precisely, the users' need has to give them sufficient activation energy to start using whatever you make, which can vary a lot. For example, the activation energy for enterprise software sold through traditional channels is very high, so you'd have to be a lot better to get users to switch. Whereas the activation energy required to switch to a new search engine is low. Which in turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise software.[4] This gets harder as you get older. While the space of ideas doesn't have dangerous local maxima, the space of careers does. There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take through life, and the older you get, the higher the walls become.[5] It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big deal. Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but the programmers had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.[6] Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal, and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies you'd noticed that day. Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and anomalies.[7] Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.There's comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them. Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas, because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the same ones.[8] For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs are the first phase of the recruiting funnel. But if you're good you can skip the first phase. If you're good you'll have no trouble getting hired by these companies when you graduate, regardless of how you spent your summers.[9] The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help their students start startups, the best thing they can do is leave them alone in the right way.[10] I'm speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.[11] This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users, not competitors. The most important information about competitors is what you learn via users anyway.[12] In practice most successful startups have elements of both. And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting the boundaries of what you call the market. But it's useful to consider these two ideas separately.[13] I almost hesitate to raise that point though. Startups are businesses; the point of a business is to make money; and with that additional constraint, you can't expect you'll be able to spend all your time working on what interests you most.[14] The need has to be a strong one. You can retroactively describe any made-up idea as something you need. But do you really need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders \"Would you use this thing yourself, if you hadn't written it?\" and you'd be surprised how often the answer is no.[15] Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad can be a source of better ideas:\"The best technique I've found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody wants what they are building, they very often come back with a real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea.\"[16] Here's a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if you're college students. If you have a connection to one of the more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants, building anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that didn't already exist. Anything that got built this way would be very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding but also the perfect point to spread from.I have no idea whether this would work.[17] And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak started out by solving his own problems. He, like most of his peers, couldn't afford a monitor.Thanks to Sam Altman, Mike Arrington, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Garry Tan, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this, and Marc Andreessen, Joe Gebbia, Reid Hoffman, Shel Kaphan, Mike Moritz and Kevin Systrom for answering my questions about startup history.\n\nYou want to know how to paint a perfect painting?
