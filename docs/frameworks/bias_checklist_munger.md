## Charlie Munger’s 25 Secret Cognitive Biases for Significantly Better Communication
Want to make better judgements for the rest of your life? Want to protect yourself from manipulation? Want to excel in a professional environment? Want a reputation for outstanding decision-making? And that’s not all: Want to learn exactly how to activate these 25 hidden, little-known, scientifically proven cognitive biases in your communication?

In this chapter, you’ll learn precisely what the 25 biases are and proven, step-by-step communication strategies activating them for instant influence, easy persuasion, guaranteed respect, better public speaking, stronger conversational skills, and superior professional communication. Let’s begin.

A Brief Review: What is a Cognitive Bias?
A cognitive bias is a systematic thinking process that typically acts as a shortcut to conserve mental resources. Cognitive biases, also called mental heuristics, can help us. Why? They keep our brains focused on important questions by taking resource-saving shortcuts around unimportant questions. But it’s a double-edged sword: They can also lead to systematic, repetitive, predictable judgement errors as a result.

Who is Charlie Munger?
Charlie Munger is one of the world’s most respected financial professionals, completely removed from the 2008 financial scandals. He is an investor, businessman, former real-estate attorney, accomplished philanthropist, and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. He lives an incredibly accomplished life. He surrounds himself with the world’s most intelligent people. In fact, he is one. He sees countless memorable events teaching him life-long lessons, and he is quick to share them.

What’s the most important life-long lesson he learned? This: Human beings have cognitive biases, and these can negatively impact us in dramatic ways by systematically jumping us to false judgements and erroneous conclusions.

Moreover, he learned this: People who succeed in life do so because they are aware of their biases and actively fight them. Want to succeed? Fight your biases so you can experience crystal-clear judgement in every single situation. It’s that simple.

When did he identify these biases? Charlie Munger first identified these biases in his famed, renowned, and legendary Harvard Law School commencement address titled The Psychology of Human Misjudgement. He expanded on them over the multiple iterations of Poor Charlie’s Almanack: a fantastic, practical, and informative chronicle of his extensive wisdom.

Let’s turn to the critical question: How can you use these biases in communication? How can you drastically, dramatically, and instantly improve your professional emails, proposals, pitches, presentations, meetings, and conversations? How can you easily influence nearly anyone and quickly persuade people to adopt your point of view? How can you supercharge your professional success by pulling back the curtain of human psychology and discovering the little-known secrets of human cognition that make people tick? Let’s get into it.

How Can You Use a Bias in Communication?
A bias is bad if it creates misjudgment. Are you trying to persuade a boardroom to adopt your offering? Obviously, you don’t perceive a purchase as a misjudgment. (Or maybe you do – in which case, pick a new line of work, or at least push a better product).

Would listening to you be good for them? Then it’s not unethical to get one (or 25) of their biases to activate, and not just activate, but specifically turn on in your favor, subconsciously pushing them to listen to you.

In summary: You can use a bias in communication by activating it in people’s minds to make them see things your way. Want an example? Let’s get into the biases and how you activate them.

Bias #1: Reward and Punishment Tendency
What is it? We adopt behaviors benefiting us, protecting us from harm, or both.

Where does it come from? Human life is choosing between behaviors and experiencing a benefit or punishment as a result of the choice.

Due to the inherent, inalienable, intrinsic nature of our existence in this universe, we evolved to seek benefits in all situations, and avoid losses in all situations. Of the two, the threat of a loss is more motivating. Why? We feel the pain of loss more than the pleasure of an equivalent gain, sometimes twice as much. Loss-aversion strikes again.

How do you use it in communication? This strategy alone will make you a better communicator than the vast majority of your professional competitors.

That’s right: Understanding this one simple concept sets you apart from the majority of people who can’t communicate effectively because they don’t.

What’s the strategy? Tell people doing what you want them to do will benefit them and protect them from loss. Tell them not doing it will waive a benefit and compel a loss. And remember this: The more benefit or loss at stake, the higher your persuasive punch.

Bias #2: Liking and Loving Tendency
What is it? We find people we like or love more persuasive, and we ignore their flaws and faults.

Where does it come from? We are social creatures who evolved in the presence of our fellow humans. This psychological tendency emerged because it conferred an evolutionary advantage (which helps us survive and thus pass on our genes containing the tendency). What’s the advantage? Stronger human relationships protecting us in urgent moments.

How do you use it in communication? Be likeable. How? That’s a pretty tall order, isn’t it? Can you just turn likability on? Is it like a light-switch? Of course not. But the following strategy is as easy as flipping a switch.

The strategy? I call it the “two mosts.” Candidly communicate to them about what they like most, and what they hate most. This invokes the previous bias. See how these strategies stack for greater persuasive power?

Talk to them about getting what they like most, and avoiding what they hate most. Simple, right? But think about someone talking to you about your two mosts. You’d naturally gravitate toward them, wouldn’t you?

Bias #3: Disliking and Hating Tendency
What is it? We find people we hate less persuasive, while amplifying their faults and ignoring their positive qualities.

Where does it come from? This is a possible explanation, and one not scientifically validated. It’s just my hypothesis. The disliking and hating tendency evolved because it activates the liking and loving tendency, which helps us survive by forming stronger human bonds.

The disliking and hating tendency offers no advantage on its own. But it activates something that does. How can hating someone make us love someone? The explanation is this: You hate person X, you hear person Y hates person X too, and now you and person Y are best buddies.

In other words, the disliking and hating tendency strengthens group bonds unified around hatred, which can help members of the in-group survive. Why? Because they have stronger bonds through the liking and loving tendency with other members of the in-group. We’ve seen historical disasters stemming from this time and time again. The short-term beneficiaries? Members of the in-group.

How do you use it in communication? People will immediately reject ideas from a source they despise. And believe it or not, you can use this. I could just tell you to avoid becoming hated. But that’s obvious and useless. Instead, I’ll uncover this strategy: Tell them an attack on your position came from a source they hate. It’s a form of inoculation, the art of inspiring people to strongly defend a position by expressing a weak attack.

An example? “Now, [insert hated person] will tell you that my position is [insert attack]. But…” Why does this work? Because telling people someone they hate attacked your stance causes them to reject the attack, thus removing a potential objection against your position. Sneaky, isn’t it?

Bias #4: Doubt Avoidance Tendency
What is it? We tend to avoid doubt. We tune-out opposing information, gravitate towards unambiguous “truths,” arbitrarily select sources of “truth,” and prematurely leap to a conclusion to escape doubt, where we remain entrenched no matter what we hear.

Where does it come from? This stems from our tendency to conserve cognitive resources. Why did we evolve to conserve cognitive resources? In the dire straits of a life-threatening situation, we need our minds to be agile and active, not sluggish from the strain of unimportant decisions. In fact, all biases stem, in part, from our tendency to conserve cognitive resources. Why? They’re all shortcuts.

How do you use it in communication? People gravitate to doubtless communicators. See where I’m going with this?

Think about it: Why do people who have little going for them but overconfidence rise to positions of leadership? Why do people take the suave, loud-talking, clear-speaking idiot seriously, just because he’s confident, as if he’s not still an idiot? Why do we accept a confident-sounding statement, but reject an identical statement when we sense even an ounce of doubt in the speaker’s voice? Because we tend to avoid doubt.

So how do you activate this bias in communication? It’s simple, but powerful: Portray confidence in your message. Speak with no reservation. Speak loudly; strongly; confidently, with your words, your voice, and your body language all conveying extreme self-belief. People will gravitate to you. They won’t be able to help it. Your confidence will draw them to you like moths to a flame, because they sense your doubtlessness.

Bias #5: Inconsistency Avoidance Tendency
What is it? People tend to avoid acting inconsistently with past actions.

Where does it come from? Our innate human desire to limit confusion and conserve cognitive resources by organizing the world in artificially neat ways, in which we always acted correctly (thus there’s no need to be inconsistent with our past selves). We also conserve mental resources by saying “I probably thought this action through the first time, so this time, I’ll trust my past-self.”

How do you use it in communication? Use consistency indicators. What are consistency indicators? Statements tying previous audience actions to your proposed action. Make it seem like doing what you want would be consistent with their history of related actions: “You’ve probably always done [insert related action; the basis for consistency]. The truth is that [insert your proposal] is essentially continuing this history of positive action, because…”

Bias #6: Curiosity Tendency
What is it? We want to know, particularly if we know there’s something we don’t know. For example, you’re more curious if I say “there are ___ tons of bananas on Earth,” than if I never said anything about Earth’s aggregate banana tonnage.

Where does it come from? Evolution. Noticing a pattern here? Funny: We also evolved to notice patterns. Why? Once again, to conserve mental resources. But how is it evolutionary? Knowing more, a function of a curious mind, helps us survive and pass on our genetic material. Thus, the genes creating curiosity survive.

How do you use it in communication? Open-loop rhetorical questions. What is an open-loop rhetorical question? I just used one. Want to get undivided attention when you speak? Want to command respect and own the room? Use these. They work because they expose a knowledge-gap, which makes the curiosity tendency more powerful and attention-grabbing.

Here’s a specific formula that also activates the reward and punishment tendency: “How do other [insert description of audience] get [insert benefit] and prevent [insert loss]?” For example, “how do other small business owners get five times more customers and prevent breaking down their supply chains?”

“What is the best way to [insert goal] without suffering [insert specific difficulty]?”

“Why is it that [insert surprising event] happens the way it does?”

“What is the little-known truth about [insert subject] that the ‘experts’ won’t tell you?”

Bias #7: Kantian Fairness Tendency
What is it? We tend to believe the world ought to be fair, treat others how we want to be treated, and get extremely, irrationally offended when someone breaches fairness.

Where does it come from? Anything that fosters positive relationships between humans helps us survive. The genes containing survival-boosting traits or tendencies, because we survive and reproduce when we have these tendencies, get passed on.

How do you use it in communication? Emotional arousal grabs attention. And negative emotions tend to produce the most emotional force. This is an emotional force that you, by now an expert communicator, can channel as a motivating drive to action. People don’t act without an emotional impetus to do so.

If you can’t create emotional arousal, you can’t get (or hold) attention, command respect, influence, persuade, communicate effectively, and motivate people to act. And if our Kantian Fairness Tendency causes extreme offense when fairness is breached, if extreme offense is a highly arousing emotion, and if high emotional arousal is necessary for effective persuasion, convince people that fairness has been breached against them.

How? With this simple, proven, step-by-step model: I call it the Victim-Perpetrator-Benevolence triad.

Part one: Victim. Tell people why someone treated them unfairly; explain why they are victims of a breach in the bond of fairness. Don’t tell them someone somewhere acted unfairly against someone else. Tell them they are victims.

Part two: Perpetrator. Who did this to them? Who, specifically, victimized them? This triad gains more force with a clear, vivid perpetrator, plus a vivid explanation of how they broke justice.

Part three: Benevolence. Paint yourself (and if you are selling something, your product) as a healing force for the victim, punishing the perpetrator and restoring justice. Explain how you can help: Don’t just say “I can help…” but elaborate on exactly how you can fix the broken justice and the victim’s problem(s). See how you can activate extremely complicated psychological machinery with relative ease, and thus experience dramatically more success as a communicator?

Bias #8: Envy and Jealousy Tendency
What is it? We hate seeing possessions or achievements we want for ourselves in the clutches of others.

Where does it come from? Our inherent need to compete for limited resources, and our attempts to satisfy our unlimited demands with a finite resource-pool.

How do you use it in communication? You can use the envy and jealousy tendency to immediately add yet another emotional pull to your offer, making it more compelling and captivating.

How? How can you make anyone vigorously want anything by activating their envy and jealousy tendency? How can you immediately make your offer seem much more attractive, possibly raking in more money for the same product? (And you are a product, as are your ideas).

Here’s how: Apply the formula “[insert rival] has [insert what you are offering] and they have protected themselves from [insert harm] while benefiting from [insert benefit].”

An example? Let’s draw one from the critically acclaimed show Mad Men. (It’s my favorite show. I’ve watched all 7 seasons, with ~15 hour-long episodes per season, probably 10 times by now. You do the math if you want).

The protagonist’s advertising agency, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (SCDP), is locked in a competitive grapple with an agency called Cutler Gleason and Chaough (CGC). Anyone trying to sell something to CGC, let’s say a professional branding service, could activate the envy and jealousy tendency like this: “SCDP recently picked up a professional branding service, protecting themselves from the rat race of obscurity while benefiting from a mountain of new business with high billings and a national presence.”

Now not only does CGC want the service for its inherent benefits; they also want it because SCDP has it and they don’t. Neat, right? The more reasons you create to want your offer, and the more emotionally compelling the reasons, the more persuasive you become. And nobody said you have to use their honorable emotions. Jealousy works just fine. But the “golden-rule” emotion, the reciprocation tendency, is available too. Let’s turn to it now.

Bias #9: Reciprocation Tendency
What is it? We seek to reciprocate behaviors, positive or negative.

Where does it come from? Evolution. Much like the loving and liking tendency, it fosters stronger human bonds. And it yields punishment in the form of negative reciprocation when those bonds are betrayed, disincentivizing betrayal.

How do you use it in communication? This one is easy. And it’s incredibly powerful. Great ease and massive efficacy wrapped up in one strategy: A good combination if I ever heard one.

How do you activate the reciprocation tendency, until people scramble to do you favors? How do you get undivided attention, complete respect, and higher rates of compliance with your professional communication? How do you make professional prospects gravitate to you, channeling opportunities in your direction?

It’s simple: Give them something. A free bite to eat. A discount. A free white-paper or industry report. A free consultation. A free referral.

There’s no such thing as a free lunch: None of these are really free. There’s a price: A strong psychological need to repay the favor in the future.

If you’re speaking to them? They’ll pay significantly more genuine consideration to your persuasive appeals, and pay you significantly more attention and respect.

Bias #10: Influence from Mere Association
What is it? When we see a new item clumped in a group of good items, we believe it is also good. When we see a new item clumped in a group of bad items, we assume it is also bad. In short: We identify the traits of a new item by extrapolating from its surroundings.

Where does it come from? Our need to conserve cognitive resources.

How do you use it in communication? There’s a convoluted, complex, and extremely expert strategy known as “semantic sentiment mapping.” It involves mathematics, balancing equations, “localized sentiment scores,” and incredibly arcane terminology.

Want to learn it? If there’s anything you discovered about yourself so far, it should be this: Your brain wants to conserve mental resources, not use them up learning semantic sentiment mapping. Or maybe your curiosity predominates right now, and you feel a dramatic urge to know.

I’ll take the middle path: I’ll offer you the bare essentials of the strategy, and explain how it activates influence by mere association to make you significantly more persuasive.

When you’re persuading, you deal with two elements. The first? An alternative to your proposal, including inaction. The second? Your proposal.

Not only do you want to nudge them towards the second, you want to keep them from leaping towards the first. How? Attach words with negative sentiment to the alternative. Describe painful associated anecdotes. Use words like “abysmal,” “painful,” “difficult,” “tiresome,” “self-defeating,” and “unnecessary.”

The core of your message – that the alternative is abysmal –influences them consciously. But they also subconsciously perceive compelling association. And mere association influences us. The association? The alternative is inundated by a clump of negative items, so it must be negative too.

And reverse it: Attach positive words and anecdotes to your proposal. Influence by mere association empowers your proposal just as it disempowers any alternatives.

Bias #11: Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial
What is it? We habitually ignore or deny psychologically painful information until it’s bearable.

Where does it come from? Our evolutionary need to maintain an active and agile mind, unbridled by draining concerns.

How do you use it in communication? When you’re persuading, you are pushing a solution to a problem. And here’s the key of effective persuasion: The bigger the harms of the problem, the more attractive the solution. Unless one obstacle derails you: Their denial tendency blinds them to the problem altogether.

This is a big obstacle for you. Huge. Why? Until you defeat denial tendency and validate the problem, you can’t create the emotional pull necessary for motivation and, ultimately, action.

How can you overcome denial tendency? How can you guarantee your persuasive appeals don’t die on arrival? How can you protect yourself from the biggest obstacle to persuasive communication?

Two strategies combined into one: Prospect-driven hypothetical admissions matched with incontrovertible proof. Ask questions like these: “If [insert problem] were true, how would that impact you?” and “If [insert proof] were the case, would you see that [insert problem] is in fact a serious threat?” These are prospect-driven hypothetical admissions.

Then apply declarations like this one: “Well, I agree with you. And sadly, this is the case. [insert proof] is true according to [insert source]. But so is [insert further proof] and [insert further proof]. Sadly, [insert problem] is very real and very harmful, and that impacts you by [insert their exact words they used when answering the first question hypothesizing on the impact].”

Why does this work? It asks them to hypothesize on the negative harms of a problem that could happen; something that could be true, but probably isn’t. Until you prove it is real. You circumvent psychological denial by painting pictures of the problem in a hypothetical world. There’s no psychological denial in a hypothetical world. Why would there be?

Bias #12: Excessive Self-Regard Tendency
What is it? We all think we are above average.

Where does it come from? Confidence is self-fulfilling. 2,000 years ago, if you overconfidently believed you could survive a mammoth hunt, self-belief helped you survive. Thus, you passed down the genes. Likewise, humans have a biological tendency to fight (physically and otherwise) only if they perceive their opponent is unwilling to fight back. Excessive self-regard tendency makes us willing to fight. So we avoid a fight in the first place, survive, and pass down excessive self-regard tendency.

How do you use it in communication? People love to see world-view symmetry. Express it. They’ll find you more persuasive. Remember liking and loving tendency? This activates it.

How do you present world-view symmetry? How do you show them you see the world how they do? It’s simple: Match their excessive tendency to over-regard themselves. How? Not by over-regarding yourself, but by over-regarding them.

Describe their organization as “cutting-edge,” “innovative,” “ahead of the curve.” Describe their personnel as “ambitious,” “capable,” “above average.” Describe their institution as “impactful,” “prestigious,” “high-end.”

Bias #13: Over-Optimism Tendency
What is it? Excess optimism is the normal human condition.

Where does it come from? It helps us conserve mental resources. It ties to many cognitive biases and mental heuristics. It lightens the burden of life on a difficult planet.

How do you use it in communication? People follow visionaries. You can’t persuade if you don’t sell your vision. You must “screen-share” your mental movie, so they see what you see; all the unfulfilled potential your proposal can help them actualize. And remember: The vision has to relate to achieving their goals.

How does over-optimism tie into this? How can you become a compelling communicator and come off as an astute visionary by activating this bias? How can you use it to achieve extreme influence and easy persuasion?

It’s simple: Don’t hold back in describing your vision. Be straightforward about the bounty of benefits. Provide some perfunctory proof; some quantitative evidence from reliable sources, and then use the authority this gave you to launch into vision-sharing; optimistic and overwhelmingly positive vision-sharing. You’ll match their optimism. And this excites people.

Bias #14: Deprival Superreaction Tendency
What is it? Loss-aversion. We prefer to avoid gains, nor ewP rewards. Sometimes twice as much. -$1,000 can be twice as painful as +$1,000 is pleasurable. And once we lose something, we react with overwhelming intensity — irrational intensity — in trying to restore the loss. We also tend to place an irrational amount of effort in pursuing a goal we just barely missed.

Where does it come from? 2,000 years ago, behaviors tied to protecting what we had — territory, resources, food, members of our tribe — probably helped us survive more than striving to get more. Thus, we are evolutionarily and genetically coded to avoid loss and play the game of life conservatively.

How do you use it in communication? Raise the stakes and explain what they can lose. But we already discussed this. What’s another way? The “you just missed it!” strategy. Tell them they were so close to achieving a goal. A deeply desired goal was in their reach, and they barely missed it. Paint your proposal as placing the “almost there!” goal in their reach once and for all.

That said: This next strategy is one of the most powerful persuasive principles I ever discovered. Like all of these cognitive biases, it is scientifically validated and proven to systematically compel people to act in predictable ways.

Bias #15: Social-Proof Tendency
What is it? We follow the crowd and look to others for direction.

Where does it come from? We have two salient evolutionary needs genetically coding this tendency. We need to conserve mental resources and we need the protection offered by a tribe. Social proof conserves mental resources because instead of using mental calories to make our own decisions, we outsource our judgement to the crowd. Secondly, it helps us maintain “group-member status” because aligning our actions with the crowd permits us into the crowd.

How do you use it in communication? Make statements evidencing a crowd acting how you want your prospects to act, or thinking how you want them to think.

“87% of [insert audience identifier, like ‘small business owners’] state that [insert the problem you solve] is a massive drain on funds.”

“97% of our customers left us a five-star review on Amazon.”

“So far, 30,000 happy customers have used our product.”

That’s quantitative social proof: Statistics. What’s qualitative social proof? What a small number of specific people said in detail. The number of positive reviews is quantitative; what one of the reviews says, in detail, is qualitative. Which one should you use? False dilemma. Use both.

Bias #16: Contrast-Misreaction Tendency
What is it? We judge items not on their inherent qualities, but on how they compare to points of reference.

Where does it come from? This is a side-effect of our cognitive machinery. It can cause silly and frequent misjudgments. We can’t judge anything on its own, unless we have a point of comparison. We’re happy with our $60,000 salary until we find out our coworker makes $62,000. But $60,000 equals $60,000, no matter what anyone else makes. Sadly, that’s not how our judgement works. We always use points of comparison to reach conclusions.

How do you use it in communication? This bias is ubiquitous in communication. Countless strategies activate it. But what’s one of the most compelling? How can you use the contrast-misreaction tendency to inspire vigorous and enthusiastic action in your favor? How can you influence people to see things your way, do what you want, and help you advance in your professional career? With the path-contrast structure, activating this incredibly powerful psychological heuristic in an extremely compelling way.

If you’re persuading, what are you really doing? Trying to get someone to take one path instead of another. And path one is meaningless and unpersuasive on its own. Path one versus path two is where real persuasion happens.

The simple, straightforward, step-by-step path-contrast process? Step one: Identify path one; what you want them to do. Explain it. Step two: Identify path two; the alternative. Explain it. Step three: Explain the benefits of path one. Step four: Explain the harms of path two. Step five: Repeat steps three and four until you heighten contrast as needed. It’s a simple, step-by-step mold that instantly activates an extremely persuasive and influential cognitive function.

Bias #17: Stress-Misinfluence Tendency
What is it? We make premature, extreme, and irrationally quick decisions under high stress.

Where does it come from? 2,000 years ago, when a saber-tooth tiger jumped in front of us, creating high cognitive stress, we needed to make a quick decision: Run, or fight? (Probably run: It has “saber-tooth” in its name…)

In this situation, a part of the brain called the amygdala turns on. It shuts down the prefrontal cortex, which performs slow, methodical, deliberate logical operations.

The problem? The amygdala turns on and suppresses logic even if we need logic to solve the source of the stress; even if it’s a sales pitch or an interview (logic-demanding), not a saber-tooth tiger (agility-demanding).

How do you use it in communication? Create stress, then ease it. Raise the stakes, then offer an escape. Paint a painful problem, then present a solution. Apply pressure, then offer relaxation.

“You have a problem. Here’s why this is an extremely terrible thing: [Stress-induce]. But I can help you. Here’s how I can prevent these harms: [Stress-ease].”

Stress puts them in a mental state of rapid-response, making it easier to persuade through emotion, and to elicit an “impulse buy.” People impulsively jump to your solution if and only if they have something to escape; if and only if they have something to jump away from: Stress. They won’t make the leap in the absence of some stress-inducing information triggering the need for escape.

Bias #18: Availability Mis-Weighing Tendency
What is it? We overweigh evidence that comes quickly to mind.

Where does it come from? Conservation of mental resources. It’s a mental short-cut that is a rough, approximate, “good enough” judgement in most cases. In other cases? It produces serious misjudgments.

How do you use it in communication? Here’s a quick refresher of the 13 strategies I advanced in the chapter on availability:

“Strategy #1: Tell Stories

Strategy #2: Use Pathos

Strategy #3: Use Sententia

Strategy #4: Project Images

Strategy #5: Make it Personal

Strategy #6: Keep it Simple

Strategy #7: Provide Tangible Takeaways

Strategy #8: Always Summarize

Strategy #9 Invoke Fear

Strategy #10: Invoke Desire

Strategy #11: Use Mnemonics

Strategy #12: Make it Eloquent

Strategy #13: Visualize Data”

Bias #19: Use It or Lose It Tendency
What is it? We lose stored information if we don’t use it.

Where does it come from? To conserve our finite budget of mental resources, we gradually dump information we don’t use.

How do you use it in communication? This isn’t something you use in communication; this is a broader piece of advice. You can read about these strategies. But if you don’t apply the insights, you lose them over time.

How do you apply it to communication? Make your message practical. Make it educational. Provide information people can use to improve their lives. They won’t forget it. They’ll use it, not lose it.

Bias #20: Drug Misinfluence Tendency
What is it? Drugs cause poor cognition.

Where does it come from? Drugs.

How do you use it in communication? I’m legally compelled to say this: Don’t drug your audience. Truth be told, there’s not much you can do to activate this tendency in an ethical way. I just wanted to include it because it was part of Munger’s 25.

Offering coffee works. Maybe some alcoholic beverages, when appropriate, to smooth over an interaction. Coffee might make your audience more attentive, and give them a dopamine hit. The happier people are, the more open they are to persuasive appeals. It also activates reciprocity, likeability, and related biases. I suppose we’ll stick with this advice: The only way to ethically activate this one is by offering coffee when it’s in your power to do so.

Bias #21: Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency
What is it? Older people are prone to more faulty cognition than younger people.

Where does it come from? Old age.

How do you use it in communication? I won’t even try with this one. It’s part of his 25, so I included it. You can’t apply it to communication. That said: The remaining four biases are some of the most compelling in the clump of 25, and directly applicable to persuasive communication.

Bias #22: Authority-Misinfluence Tendency
What is it? We find authority figures persuasive.

Where does it come from? This probably facilitated more fruitful and well-organized tribe- and group-relations, and as a result, helped us survive. It also conserves mental resources. It would strain our cognitive resources to learn the entire medical discipline when we have a sickness. It’s more efficient to outsource to an expert.

How do you use it in communication? This one is tremendously powerful. People will do nearly anything if an authority figure tells them to. It’s part of the horror of warfare.

We listen to doctors, coaches, and experts because they are doctors, coaches, and experts. When a doctor or scientist says something, we take it at face value.

How can you use this proven and powerful psychological tendency for more compelling communication? How can you use it for easy persuasion? How can you portray your authority without bragging and achieve instant trust?

It’s simple: What are your credentials? What’s your experience? Why should they trust you? Answer these questions. And there’s a principle called authority-transfer: You adopt part of the authority of the evidence you advance, the experts you cite, and the organization you represent. Keep that in mind, and activate authority-transfer in tandem with presenting direct authority.

Now: Why do we procrastinate? How can you overcome people doing what you want “later?” Let’s turn to bias 23 for the answer.

Bias #23: Twaddle Tendency
What is it? Spending significant time on useless activities. Procrastinating.

Where does it come from? Our innate drive to keep cognitive load down. Why procrastinate? Because it’s mentally easier. Starting the next task, or taking the next action, taxes our discipline. Our discipline functions like a finite budget: It runs out eventually. After a long day, when we know the next task is mentally straining, we twaddle because it’s just easier.

How do you use it in communication? This one is extremely detrimental to achieving your goals if left unchecked. It can undermine everything you say. It can kill an otherwise perfect presentation or pitch. It can ruin your attempts to influence, no matter what else you say or do. Even if you activate the other biases, even if you provide evidence, logic, and emotional appeals, and even if the people like you on a personal level, the twaddle tendency can derail everything.

How do you avoid this? By answering the question “why now?” What’s the problem so many communicators face? They focus on the wrong question. They focus on answering the question “why?” But that’s incorrect. You can convince someone on the “why?” but they won’t act until you definitively answer “why now?”

I want to travel the world; telling me why I should want to is useless. Why? Because I already do. But I don’t want to travel the world now. I have other things to do first (like earn the money I need to travel the world). The question I need to hear you talk about is why I should do it now. Remember this mantra, and you’ll be okay: “‘Why now?’ not ‘why?’”

Bias #24: Reason Respecting Tendency
What is it? We respect requests and believe statements justified by reasons.

Where does it come from? One of the processes we use to conserve cognitive resources is called substitution. We substitute an easy question for a hard one. How does this interact with reason-respecting tendency? We substitute the easy question “is there a reason for this?” for the hard question “is this a good and valid reason?” Simply hearing a reason often does the trick, even if it’s invalid.

How do you use it in communication? Provide justifiers and meta-justifiers. What’s a meta-justifier? Meta-justifiers are incredibly compelling, captivating, and attention-grabbing. They justify the communication itself: “I’m calling today because I want to tell you about…”

What’s a regular justifier? Regular justifiers justify a particular request or a statement: “[insert statement] because [insert reason],” or “could you [insert request] because [insert reason]?”

And now, we turn to the single most important concept in this book: What Munger calls the “Lollapalooza tendency.”

Bias #25: The Lollapalooza Tendency
What is it? Any psychological tendency pushing a particular behavior persuades. Multiple pushing the same behavior persuade exponentially more, resulting in massive persuasive force. Munger calls it a “lollapalooza effect.” It happens when multiple cognitive biases converge all at once, in the same direction.

Where does it come from? It comes from the individual influence of each bias. Combined, their persuasion is more than their sum. It is a case of one plus one equals three.

How do you use it in communication? You know how to activate the other 24 cognitive biases. So how do you activate the lollapalooza tendency? Activate the other biases, all at once, and in the same direction. It’s easy: You already know exactly how to activate them individually, and the results will shock you when you combine their persuasive power. And it doesn’t have to be all 24. Even two at once activates this.

Charlie Munger’s 25 Cognitive Biases Conclusion
