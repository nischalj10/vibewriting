## Effective Decision Making Framework

**\[1\] Risk assessments \-** “All I Want To Know Is Where I'm Going To Die So I'll Never Go There”

* Pre-mortem analysis: Developed by Gary Klein. Imagine that a plan has failed and work backwards to determine what could have gone wrong. The process:  
  * The plan has failed: Arrange a meeting of your people. Announce that “the plan has failed.” This helps frame the conversation to change the mindset and allow for counterfactual thinking.  
  * Take a pause: Give the team time to process the hypothetical failure.   
  * Write down what happened: Team members individually write reasons for the plan's failure.  
  * Share ideas one at a time: The leader orchestrates the sharing of ideas, starting with themselves.  
  * Write down actions to mitigate risk: The team brainstorms ways to prevent negative outcomes.   
  * Share risk prevention actions: Initiate a round of hearing mitigation strategies.

* Inversion: Favorite of Charlie Munger’s. Think through problems backwards, considering what you want to avoid rather than what you want to achieve.

* Red teams: Used by Andy Golden. Split teams into “blue teams” and “red teams”. Red teams conduct research and find flaws in recommendations given by blue teams.   
  * Arrange a diverse red team: Helps mitigate personal bias of individual team members  
  * Red team should not be personally invested in recommendation: Helps avoid self-serving bias  
  * Don’t hold back: Red team should be able to speak whatever is on their mind. To enable this, red team could submit through anonymous ballots  
* Riskiest assumption test \- One foot at a time in untested waters  
  * Seek Subject matter expertise: If you don’t have it, seek outside intervention.  
  * Test with minimal time and resources: Seek people testing the same things and partner with them

**\[2\] Independence:** “Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked.”

* Objectivity and rationality require independence of thought  
* Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn’t make you right or wrong \- the only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgement

**\[3\] Margin of Safety \-** Always allow room for error or uncertainty in outcomes.

**\[4\] Opportunity Costs:** Consider what you give up by choosing one option over another.

**\[5\] Decisiveness \-** When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction

* Opportunity doesn’t come often, so seize it when it comes  
* Opportunity meeting the prepared mind; that’s the game

**\[6\] Intellectual Humility \-** Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawn of wisdom

* Stay within a well-defined circle of competence  
* Seek disconfirming evidence. Talk to people with opposing views.

**\[7\] Bias checklist \-** Biases are not necessarily wrong. But most obvious source of errors. Tendency does not always mean destiny, and knowing the tendencies and their antidotes can often help prevent trouble that would otherwise occur. Avoid overconfidence bias. Don’t rush to make decisions. Don’t mimic your competitors.

* Overconfidence bias is the tendency to overestimate our knowledge and abilities in a certain area. We don’t know what we don’t know. One way to mitigate this is to keep a higher limit on spending. Carve smaller decisions which can at best affect \<1% of your outcome.  
* Doubt-avoidance tendency is the tendency to reach a decision immediately. The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision. Take time. Write down. Take a walk. Sleep on it is probably the best mitigation strategy for such biases.  
* Social-Proof Tendency is the tendency to think and act as others around you or businesses in your industry do. What is good for your competitor’s customers may not be good for you automatically. Remembering that the average IQ of people is 100 with a std deviation of only 18\. 

**\[8\] Change \-** when fundamentals change, re-do all the above to update your views and assign probabilities to different outcomes based on new information

**\[9\] Reversible Or Irreversible Decisions \-** 

* Ask: Can this decision be easily undone or adjusted if it doesn’t work out?  
* If not, Can this decision be modified to allow for reversibility?
